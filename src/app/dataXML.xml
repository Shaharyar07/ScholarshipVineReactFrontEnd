This program will focus on building cultures of research at Zimbabwean universities and establishing research methods that translate into artistic content creation that bolsters social contracts and civic engagement; building or expanding research capacity that influences better content design; connecting Zimbabweans with their U.S. counterparts and catalyzing partnerships. All program proposals must strengthen ties and build relationships between the United States and Zimbabwe and must have a strong, central, American element, or connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s (separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Mission or its American Corners or U.S. government exchange program alumni), and have as a primary goal the promotion of increased understanding of U.S. values, perspectives, and policies and relationship building between Americans and Zimbabweans. For program proposals that include elements of in-person travel between Zimbabwe and the United States, or other international locations, travel should not be planned until September 2022 at the earliest. All program proposals, including those with exchange components, should include flexibility in planning to adjust given the constantly evolving global and local restrictions related to COVID-19. This program supports the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s Public Diplomacy efforts to deliver strategic content that strengthens social fabric and democratic principles. Proposals should be submitted to PublicDiplomacyGrants-ZIM@state.gov by April 15, 2022. Theory of Change: If universities in Zimbabwe increase their ability to collaborate and improve their research capacity and artists engaged in shaping public discourse understand how to use research to improve their content design, then Zimbabwe and U.S. counterparts will be better position to contribute to national development strategies in Zimbabwe. Key Deliverables: The 18-month exchange program seeks to accomplish the program&#8217;s goals through the completion of the following deliverables: Online Capacity-Building sessions on research methodologies, grant applications and compliance for Zimbabwean university faculty and staff (approximately 25). Additional topics could include (but not limited to) market-based research, private-sector integrations, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, important characteristics of a productive research environment and building up under-graduate student research capacities. Proposals should include a wide range of topics that focus on how to foster a culture of research, including: &#183; Value and importance of a culture research designs and methods to generate more rigorous evidence and the use of that evidence to inform the design of interventions, program and policies that go beyond. &#183; Share techniques on how to conduct research the positive deviance approach to organize social change in areas such as public health, education, human rights, poverty alleviation, sustainable development, civic participation, democracy and governance, and corporate citizenship. &#183; Entertainment-education strategy to alleviate a social issue or educate the public through a custom-tailored piece of entertainment. Designing content defined by research methodologies for various levels of media to communicate social and behavior change. The &quot;impact issue&quot; usually comes first; the characters and story are built around the issue; and impact issues are woven into or extracted out of an existing narrative. &#183; Modeling liberating interactional structures to design content that overcomes limiting behaviors and patterns in thinking and interacting, and provides tools for a community in their decision making through engaging, energizing, and fun practices. &#183; Other key areas that support this effort. 2. Professional Networking Activities that support new collaborations that link together research methods for public education and the creative design community. 3. Launch of &#8220;model&#8221; public education campaign that brings to life the research to strategic content design process in order to foster positive civil engagement and strengthen social fabric by encouraging collaboration over conflict when dealing with difficult issues. Program Participants and Beneficiaries In partnership with the Public Diplomacy section at the U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe, the program will target up to 25 Zimbabwean researchers and artistic content creators to collaboratively design a campaign that aims to strengthen social fabric and reinforce civil society. Recruitment and selection will be jointly conducted by the grantee and the U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe. In consultation with the U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe, the number of participants in each program component may change depending on local conditions and budget considerations.

Acoustic telemetry arrays will be re-deployed similar to the pre-restoration effort and analyses of detection patterns will be evaluated accordingly to provide a robust pre- and post-restoration comparison. In addition, benthic sampling and subsequent analyses will be replicated during the post-restoration phase to evaluate potential changes in habitat condition and macrofaunal composition. Identified project tasks are: 1. Capture, process and telemetry tag late-stage juvenile and adult stage Gulf Sturgeon in the Pearl and/or Pascagoula rivers. Netting will occur during summer and fall months during 2022-2024. 2. Construct, deploy, maintain, and retrieve acoustic telemetry array at Ship Island. The array will be deployed 2022-2027 with the deployment period extending September-June. 3. Download the acoustic array at regular intervals and provide data summaries for upward reporting by ERDC. 4. Work collaboratively with ERDC to analyze data and develop occupancy trends between project phases (pre- and post-restoration) and project zones. Methods: Successful applicants should have expert knowledge of Gulf Sturgeon life history and extensive familiarity and experience with netting and handling of endangered fish species. Netting within riverine habitats and tagging will follow the general guidelines recommended by the USFWS and NOAA. The candidates should have sufficient experience with telemetry-based projects and a record that demonstrates research experience with collecting and analyzing these types of data. In addition, the candidates will secure all necessary permits (state and/or federal) required for conducting the proposed research. The candidates will be required to prepare a Statement of Work and Work Plan regarding the research to be conducted. The candidates will also be required to submit status reports to accompany billing invoices (monthly or quarterly) and one (1) annual report each year of the cooperative agreement to provide updates on data collection and analysis. Deliverables will include written products that address the following: 1. Timing and duration of Gulf Sturgeon occurrences within the Ship Island project area. 2. Occupancy patterns by Gulf Sturgeon in response to habitat changes at Ship Island. 3. Comparative timing and habitat use by Gulf Sturgeon from different natal drainages at Ship Island. 4. Correspondence between Gulf Sturgeon habitat associations at Ship Island and macrofaunal composition. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Strategy for American Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing states that worldwide competition in manufacturing has been dominated in recent decades by the maturation, commoditization, and widespread application of computation in production equipment and logistics, effectively leveling the global technological playing field and placing a premium on low wages and incremental technical improvements.[1]Thenextgeneration of technological competition in manufacturing will be dictated by a combination of the use of computation to ensure the reliable translation of product designs to manufacturing plans;process controls that provide assurances that the execution of those plans will produce products that meet specifications;inventions of new materials, chemicals, devices, systems, processes, machines, and design and work methods;and new social structures and business practices. Fundamental research will be required in robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, chemical conversion processes, materials science, sustainability, education and public policy, and workforce development to lead this global competition. The goal of Future Manufacturing is to support fundamental research and education of a future workforce to overcome scientific, technological, educational, economic, and social barriers in order to catalyze new manufacturing capabilities that do not exist today.Future Manufacturing imagines manufacturing decades into the future. It supports research and education that will enhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing by providing new capabilities for established companies and entrepreneurs, by improving our health, quality of life, and national security, by expanding job opportunities to a diverse STEM workforce, and by reducing the impact of manufacturing on the environment. At the same time, Future Manufacturing enables new manufacturing that will address urgent social challenges arising from climate change, global pandemics and health disparities, social and economic divides, infrastructure deficits of marginalized populations and communities, and environmental sustainability. Future Manufacturing will require creative convergent approaches in science, technology and innovation, empirical validation, and education and workforce development. It will benefit from cross-disciplinary partnerships among scientists, mathematicians, engineers, social and behavioral scientists, and experts in arts and humanities to provide solutions that are equitable and inclusive. Future Manufacturing will require major advances in technologies for the synthesis and production of new materials chemicals, devices, components and systems of assured quality with high yield at reasonable cost. It will require new advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, new cyber infrastructure, new approaches for mathematical and computational modeling, new dynamics and control methodologies, new ways to integrate systems biology, synthetic biology and bioprocessing, and new ways to influence the economy, workforce, human behavior, and society. Among this array of technologies and potential research subjects, three thrust areas have been identified for support in FY 2022 under this solicitation: Future Cyber Manufacturing Research, Future Eco Manufacturing Research, and Future Biomanufacturing Research. This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas. This solicitation will support the following two award tracks: Future Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG)- up to $3,000,000 for up to four years; and Future Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG)-up to $500,000 for up to two years. Interdisciplinary teams commensurate with the scope of the proposed research, education plan, and budget are required. Proposals must include demonstrated expertise among the team members to carry out the proposed research, education, and workforce development activities. The use of a convergence approach is expected[2].Teams including minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges are especially encouraged. The goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see &quot;Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for additional details. Realization of thebenefitsof the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board has recently emphasized this perspective in its report, &quot;THE SKLLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE: Crafting America&apos;s Science and Engineering Enterprise.&quot;[3]Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include a plantoequip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see &quot;Full Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for additional details.

This program will expand opportunities to promote diversity of cultural expression; develop institutional capacity, competitiveness, and financial sustainability of creative and cultural organizations; and inspire independent creative and cultural organizations to create content to defend human rights and civil liberties. All program proposals must strengthen ties and build relationships between the United States and Zimbabwe and must have a strong, central, American element, or connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s (separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Mission or its American Corners or U.S. government exchange program alumni), and have as a primary goal the promotion of increased understanding of U.S. values, perspectives, and policies and relationship building between Americans and Zimbabweans. For program proposals that include elements of in-person travel between Zimbabwe and the United States, or other international locations, travel should not be planned until September 2022 at the earliest. All program proposals, including those with exchange components, should include flexibility in planning to adjust given the constantly evolving global and local restrictions related to COVID-19. This program supports the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s Public Diplomacy efforts to build a more stable, inclusive economy for the Zimbabwe creative industry. Proposals should be submitted to PublicDiplomacyGrants-ZIM@state.gov by April 15, 2022. Theory of Change: If the Zimbabwean creative community developed the industry linkages and services, then they would be included in a global artistic e-economy and be better position to contribute to national development strategies in Zimbabwe. Key Deliverables: 1. Strengthening collaborations between Zimbabwe and U.S. creative enterprises Increase and promote opportunities for collaboration between Zimbabwean and U.S. creative organizations. The partnerships should be mutually beneficial and reinforcing. Opportunities for engagement should be created between creative and cultural practitioners and audiences in Zimbabwe and the U.S. Partnerships can be virtual or physical. Emphasis should be on building long term relationships. PDS will support new or existing initiatives to invigorate local communities with ideas, information, questions, and discourse around creative expression. Priority will be given to proposals that integrate awareness and understanding of American culture, society, history and/or current events, as well as of shared American-Zimbabwean values and interests. Partnerships should facilitate creation of content that attracts and retains significant and diverse audiences in an equitable manner between Zimbabwe and the U.S. 2. Enhancing development of an inclusive creative economy The objective is to expand the range and scope of creative interventions that target marginal communities and key groupings such as but not limited to women, youth, people living with disabilities and indigenous minority communities. Projects with a strong inclination towards sustained income generation beyond project interventions are particularly encouraged. Partnerships that explore mechanisms to promote awareness of and protection of Intellectual Property across the creative value chain are favorable. The PD Section is desirous of projects that facilitate enhanced citizen participation in the cultural life of their communities through dedicated paying audience development efforts. Interventions on creative skills development and professionalization of creative enterprises in so far as they directly contribute to vibrant local level creative economies are encouraged. 3. Leveraging cultural expression for improved protection of human rights and civil liberties Successful proposals will include collaborations that deploy creative interventions in actions to improve respect, protection, and fulfillment of human rights and civil liberties. Creative campaigns to enhance citizen awareness of their rights and responsibilities are eligible. Reference to and inspiration from the US civil rights movement campaigns encouraged albeit with applicable and appropriate local adaptations. The PD Section will favorably note proposals that enhance citizen agency and inform and influence public processes. Successful proposals will emphasize the ability to deliver thoughtful creative content to defined audiences. In the context of COVID-19 where large public gatherings remain forbidden, the program will support ventures that pivot to the digital realm or scale-up ongoing digital work. Program Participants and Beneficiaries Proposals must engage with Zimbabwean creative and cultural organizations as well as audiences. Programs can promote inclusivity by targeting women, youth, people living with disabilities and rural communities.

These four-year cooperative agreements will support partnerships between Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Lead Agencies in states, territories, or tribes and institutions with demonstrated research capacity to develop rigorous investigations of child care subsidy policies and practices. Sponsored projects will inform local and federal understanding about the efficacy of child care subsidy policies and practices to increase low-income families&#8217; access to quality child care. To ensure that the funded work is timely and relevant to the current child care context, projects are expected to be collaborative from start to finish. The CCDF Lead Agency and their research partners must work together throughout all phases of the project and are encouraged to engage other interested parties, as appropriate. This iteration of the CCPRP Grants Program will prioritize research projects exploring (1) evidence-informed approaches to measuring quality across different provider types and (2) approaches to building the supply of high-quality child care through targeted investments in the early childhood workforce. Sponsored projects will be expected to participate in a consortium that will meet and communicate regularly to identify opportunities for coordination, such as common data elements and research methods, and to develop collective expertise and resources for the field. The consortium&#8217;s collaboration will support research capacity and learning within individual projects and across recipients.

Since 2008, funding through the WNS Grants to States has led to critical information and resources for maximizing the benefits of bat conservation efforts by States. In 2019, this funding opportunity was extended to Tribes engaged in, or seeking to engage in, bat management and conservation efforts. The goal of this funding opportunity is to help our State and Tribal partners fulfill information needs, implement management actions for WNS and susceptible bat species, and actively engage in the National Response to WNS. Supported activities will include population monitoring, implementation of bat conservation strategies, supporting scientific information gathering, managing WNS and Pd, maintaining expertise, and engaging in the national response to WNS. Proposals for this program will be plans of action responsive to the current status of WNS in the applicant&#8217;s location, and will address context-specific conservation needs of bats as well as the ecosystem as a whole. These priorities are intended to address relevant projects in State or Tribal jurisdictions whether WNS is already affecting resident bats or the fungus has not yet arrived. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This RFI provides the broader research community with an opportunity to contribute views and opinions regarding the technology and economics of reprocessing facilities. The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211;Energy (ARPA&#8208;E) in the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking comments on the draft technical section of a potential future Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for the CURIE program. This new program would focus on innovative technologies and approaches that will significantly improve the economics of commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities, improve reprocessing material accountancy while decreasing materials attractiveness, and drastically reduce the volume of high-level waste (HLW) requiring permanent disposal. An ARPA-E workshop was held in July 2021 to help identify and refine metrics for this contemplated program; presentations can be found here. Such technological advancements would enable a 1&#162;/kWh fuel cost for a secure 200 MTHM/yr facility that does not generate pure plutonium streams while significantly reducing the volume of high-level waste requiring disposal. ARPA&#8208;E seeks input from experts in the fields of separations chemistry (e.g., solvent extraction, pyroprocessing, halide volatility, etc.); head-end processing (e.g., voloxidation, Kr/Xe capture, etc.); process intensification; material accountancy/online monitoring; project engineering; techno-economic analysis; digital engineering; systems analysis and risk assessment; advanced manufacturing and construction (including modular fabrication); artificial intelligence, machine learning, and digital twins; and sensors, instrumentation, autonomous operation, and robotics.

EPSCoR jurisdictions that are eligible for RII competitions are listed in the RII Eligibility table, which can be foundhere. Through this program, NSF establishes partnerships with government, higher education, and industry that are designed to effect sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction&apos;s research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity, and hence, its R&amp;D competitiveness. One of the strategic goals of the EPSCoR program is to establish sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professional development pathways that advance STEM workforce development. EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track 4: EPSCoR Research Fellows provides awards to build researchcapacityin institutions and transform the career trajectories of investigators and further develop their individual research potential through extended collaborative visits to the nation&#8217;s premier private, governmental, or academic research centers. Through collaborative research visits at the host site, fellowship awardees will be able to learn new techniques, develop new collaborations or advance existing partnerships, benefit from access to unique equipment and facilities, and/or shift their research toward potentially transformative new directions. The experiences gained through the fellowships are intended to have lasting impacts that will enhance the Fellows&#8217; research trajectories well beyond the award period. These benefits to the Fellows are also expected to improve the research capacity of their institutions and jurisdictions more broadly.&#8239; Principal Investigators&#8239;must either hold a non-tenured faculty appointment at an institution of higher education or an early-career, career-track appointment at an eligible non-degree-granting institution.Only single-PI proposals will be considered. No co-PIs should be included in the proposal. EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track 4: EPSCoR Research Fellows offers the following tracks: RII Track-4:NSF and RII Track-4:Fellows Advancing Science and Technology (RII Track-4: FAST).&#8239; While they are similar in achieving the same goals, RII Track-4:NSF is open to a broad community and RII Track-4:FAST focuses on faculty from specific institutions of higher education to collaborate with researchers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) participating research centers.&#8239; PIs who are eligible for both tracks may apply for only one track per competition cycle. RII Track-4:NSF provides support to further develop the individual research potential of Principal Investigators (PIs) through extended collaborative visits to the Nation&#8217;s premier private, governmental, or academic research centers of their choice. RII Track-4:FAST provides opportunities for PIs from specific institutions of higher education with high enrollments oftraineesfrom underrepresented populations in STEM (See Section&quot;IV. Eligibility Information&quot; for more details).&#8239;Trainees must beundergraduate or graduate studentsenrolled full-time in an accredited degree program.The aim of this opportunity is to further develop their individual research potential through extended collaborative visits to NASA research facilities located at NASA Centers throughout the United States. &#8239; </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

A key aspect of the SWIFT program, now in its third year, is its focus on effective spectrum utilization and/or coexistence techniques, especially with passive uses, which have received less attention from researchers. Coexistence is when two or more applications use the same frequency band at the same time and/or at the same location, yet do not adversely affect one another. Coexistence is especially difficult when at least one of the spectrum users is passive, i.e., not transmitting any radio frequency (RF) energy. Examples of coexisting systems may include passive and active systems (e.g., radio astronomy and wireless broadband communication systems, or airborne and elevated transmitters such as satellites) or two active systems (e.g., weather radar and Wi-Fi). Example topics include communications at scale such as large-scale MIMO and intelligence surfaces, reconfigurable transceivers, energy efficient and low-power communications, innovative spectrum use and management such as joint communication and sensing, and resilient spectrum sharing, just to name a few. Another topic of interest is the growing challenge of coexistence between ground-based astronomy and large networks of low-Earth orbiting satellites, including sunlight reflections, thermal emissions, and optical/infrared inter-satellite links. As ground-based optical/infrared astronomy continues to advance in sensitivity and breadth of sky coverage, the need to maintain and enhance this capability in an increasingly congested optical/infrared/radio environment will become increasingly acute. Research projects to address these issues may involve innovative satellite technology and designs that take into account satellite constellation requirements (e.g., thermal balance), innovations in astronomical instrumentation or post-processing algorithms, advancements in coordination methodologies (e.g., use of telemetry or orbital information), and other solutions. The goal of these research projects may be the creation of new technology or significant enhancements to existing wireless infrastructure, with an aim to benefit society by improving spectrum utilization and ancillary challenges, beyond mere spectrum efficiency. The SWIFT program encourages collaborative team research that transcends the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines.

Transposable elements and mobile DNA, which comprise almost 50% of the human genome, are typically silenced through strong epigenetic modifications. When transposable elements and mobile DNA become active in people who use drugs of abuse, they potentially provide multiple integration sites for HIV in microglia. HIV integration into these unstable regions could lead to major chromosomal rearrangements and global dysregulation of transcription, ultimately contributing to HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) and providing a mechanism by which drugs of abuse increase the probability of reactivating microglial HIV reservoirs. Understanding the factors that influence HIV integration in these microglial reservoirs is crucial to developing next-generation HIV therapies and potential cures. This concept addresses these gaps by fostering studies aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the complex interplay among HIV, substances of abuse, inflammation, and disease progression.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Network will also serve as a nucleus for expanding the use of human temporal bones in the research community and to facilitate communication and collaboration between laboratories, both Network laboratories and non-Network laboratories, using human temporal bones. The Network laboratories will develop and provide technical services for procuring, preparing, sectioning and distributing high-quality human ear tissues; develop and disseminate techniques for improved tissue preservation and processing; and optimize methods for visualizing human middle and inner ear structures, including cellular and membranous components; upload digitized temporal bone images to NIDCD-approved databases for wide dissemination; provide opportunities for technicalinstruction in the special skills needed to ear tissue for use from post-mortem human temporal bones; provide outreach to the scientific and clinical communities to promote the use of human temporal bones in their research and to facilitate the use of resources maintained and developed under this initiative. In addition, applications from individual laboratories may propose research to improve current techniques for the processing and use of human temporal bones. A cooperative agreement will coordinate interactions between the Network laboratories and the research community to maximize impact while avoiding duplicative e?orts. This national resource will benefit a broad spectrum of research projects, including clinical and translational, by providing a critical link towards the translation of animal studies to the human ear and eventually the clinic, supporting the NIDCD mission to</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance (see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1)). The date shown of 3/29/2023 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-22 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-23 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-22 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022.

For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance (see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1)). The date shown of 3/29/2023 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-22 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-23 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-22 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements.

For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

This Request for Information(RFI) was developed in coordination with the Advanced Manufacturing Office. This RFI is issued to obtain feedback on the status of and opportunities for technologies that support goals in BIL section 40314, amending the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT). The BIL added a new section 815 on clean hydrogen manufacturing and recycling research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) and a new section 816 for the establishment of the Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program to EPACT. The EPACT Sec. 815 activities are grouped into a Clean Hydrogen Manufacturing Initiative (815a) focused on enhancing domestic manufacturing of clean hydrogen use, storage, and related equipment and a Clean Hydrogen Technology Recycling RD&amp;D Program (815b) that covers recycling of equipment for clean hydrogen processing, delivery, storage, and use, including fuel cells. The Clean Hydrogen Electrolysis Program in section 816 expands on DOE&#8217;s existing, comprehensive Program on electrolysis and is a research, development, demonstration, commercialization, and deployment program aimed at improving efficiency, increasing durability, and reducing capital costs of electrolyzers, thus facilitating the commercialization of clean hydrogen electrolyzer technology. DOE does not intend to publish information collected through this RFI; input will be used to develop and refine the programs. The full text of this RFI is available on EERE Exchange (https://eere-exchange.energy.gov). Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to H2RFI@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. (ET) on March 29th, 2022. If possible, please copy and paste the RFI questions and use them as a template for your response. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25 MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Responses must be provided as a Microsoft Word (*.docx) or Adobe Acrobat (*.pdf) attachment to the email. Only electronic responses will be accepted. DOE will not respond to individual submissions or publicly publish a compendium of responses. A response to this RFI will not be viewed as a binding commitment to develop or pursue the project or ideas discussed. Respondents are requested to provide the following information at the start of their response to this RFI: &#8226; Company/institution name &#8226; Company/institution contact &#8226; Contact&apos;s address, phone number, and e-mail address.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This is the official listing of all federally recognized Tribes in the United States pursuant to Section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-454; 108 Stat. 4791-4792). The most recent Notice was published in the Federal Register, 86 FR 7554 (January 29, 2021) and was corrected in the Federal Register, 86 FR 86 18552 (April 9, 2021). Tribal organizations and other entities may participate as sub-grantees or contractors to federally recognized Tribes. This information is available here under the heading Tribal Leaders Directory. Applicant Tribes must bring all administrative and fiscal reporting for open TWG Program grants up to date in order to be eligible to apply for new funds. Applicants will be notified within five business days upon receiving proposals noting any outstanding reporting issues that need to be addressed. Tribes will then have thirty days to bring these grants into compliance. Proposals from Tribes that have not brought past due reports (e.g., interim or final performance reports, or interim or final financial status reports) up to date in this 30-day period will be found ineligible and excluded from further consideration in the FY 2022 TWG Program cycle. When an applicant is carrying two or more active TWG projects while applying for another, the Service has an administrative obligation to verify that there are no correctable problems in implementing the existing awards. We will review the reasons why those grants are still open before proceeding with further consideration. Tribes that demonstrate their effective use of TWG Program funds will not be affected. Tribes that have taken no significant action on any one of their two or more preexisting awards will not be considered eligible to apply for new TWG Program funds until the problem is resolved. Possible resolutions might be for the Tribe to demonstrate progress in the agreed-upon activities of an inactive grant, demonstrate that the assertion of &#8220;no action&#8221; is incorrect, or the Tribe may cancel the grant so that the obligated funds may be recovered and made available to other Tribes in the next grant cycle.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>Agency Code:</td><td>DOI-FWS</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>Agency Name:</td><td>Department of the Interior<br>Fish and Wildlife Service</td></tr><tr><td>Posted Date:</td><td>Feb 14, 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Close Date:</td><td>Jun 24, 2022 Electronically submitted applications in GrantSolutions or Grants.gov or applications&#160;emailed to your WSFR Regional Office must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m.&#160;ET&#160;on the application due date.

Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance (see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1)). The date shown of 3/29/2023 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-22 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-23 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-22 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022.

Survivors from underserved populations face challenges in accessing comprehensive and effective victim services that are accessible, culturally relevant, and responsive. As a result, survivors from underserved communities often do not receive appropriate services. The Underserved Program supports projects that address these gaps. Funds may be used to: develop or enhance population specific victim services; develop or enhance outreach strategies to reach underserved survivors; build the capacity of population specific organizations to serve survivors of these crimes; build the capacity of victim service providers to provide victim services that are population specific; train and educate community partners and the criminal justice system on the needs of survivors from underserved populations; and develop culturally and linguistically appropriate materials for underserved survivors.

SUMMARY The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is the public health agency in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS ensures food safety through the authorities of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act, as well as humane animal handling through the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The Office of Public Health Science (OPHS)&#8212;one of many program areas supporting FSIS&#8217; mission&#8212;brings public health leadership to USDA-FSIS to assure the establishment and support of scientifically sound food safety programs. The OPHS Risk Assessment and Analytics Staff (RAAS) conducts scientific risk assessments and develops new analytic methods for assessing risks of biological and chemical hazards in meat, poultry and egg products that inform risk management decisions and risk communication activities. RAAS&#8217; scientific and technical analyses guide, support and enhance FSIS public health goals as they relate to regulatory initiatives, internal policy-making, data collection, research priorities, and the USDA-FSIS food safety goals. FSIS recently announced it will develop a stronger and more comprehensive food safety framework for the control of Salmonella in poultry. Several initiatives are underway to incorporate the latest science, data and laboratory technology into FSIS&#8217;s decision-making to identify ways to control Salmonella in poultry and reduce foodborne illness. FSIS is developing two separate risk assessment models, in chicken and in turkey. These production-to-consumption risk models will estimate reductions in foodborne illness attributed to chicken and to turkey resulting from control of Salmonella. Specifically, the models will predict the impact of: &#183; controlling Salmonella prevalence, levels (enumeration), and subtypes of public health concern pre-harvest and post-harvest, &#183; implementing preharvest controls, post-harvest controls, and combined pre- and post-harvest controls, and &#183; establishing criteria limiting Salmonella prevalence, levels and/or subtypes, or requiring a specified reduction in a relevant indicator organism. Inputs will include prevalence, levels, and subtypes of Salmonella at various points in the production-to-consumption chain, along with pre-harvest and post-harvest production practices. FSIS will be able to use FSIS-generated data for some of the model inputs. Other inputs may be informed by published scientific studies, or expert elicitations. Outputs will include prevalence and levels of Salmonella, and Salmonella subtypes, at other points in the chain and the corresponding predicted public health impact, i.e., reduction in foodborne illnesses, of Salmonella control strategies. In this way, the risk assessment models enable FSIS to assess risk management options. Before any information is released to the public or disseminated to individuals beyond authorized users under the collaborative agreement, the collaborator must submit to USDA draft copies of all papers, publications and/or products to be reviewed, strictly for confidentiality purposes. In addition, USDA will review draft papers, publications and/or products to ensure consistency with the scope of the purposes described above. We encourage applications from multi-disciplinary teams, to ensure we have the broad expertise needed. Applications from minority serving institutions are encouraged. FSIS seeks a collaboration in the following areas: 1) Existing industry data. FSIS is seeking to collaborate with researchers who can gather and analyze data from the chicken and turkey industries. This would include data considered proprietary in nature. FSIS 508 compliance rules must be adhered to when sharing information with FSIS. FSIS considers data generated by producers and processors of poultry potentially useful in developing these production-to-consumption risk models. For FSIS to effectively evaluate risk management options, it is essential to learn more about current prevalence and levels of Salmonella and Salmonella subtypes across the industry, the types of industry practices and food safety controls that are currently being used, and effects of these practices and controls. The following are examples of the types of data that could be useful in developing a production-to-consumption process simulation risk assessment model to assess the effects of FSIS risk management options: a) Preharvest i) Proportion and effectiveness of preharvest controls being used and whether these controls have different effects on different Salmonella subtypes (1) vaccination (2) biosecurity (3) feed (4) water treatments (5) probiotics/prebiotics (6) bird density (7) bedding management (8) waste management (9) other specific Salmonella control strategies on the farm ii) Proportion and types of pre-harvest testing and the results of such testing b) Postharvest i) Effectiveness of postharvest controls and whether these controls vary based on differences in subtypes (1) staging slaughter of more highly contaminated flocks (2) chemical interventions, high-pressure pasteurization, irradiation, ozone, or other treatments (refer to the FSIS Guideline for Controlling Salmonella in Raw Poultry: FSIS-GD-2021-0005 (usda.gov) for additional guidance) ii) Types and results of testing (pathogens, indicator organisms) (1) products (2) frequency (3) serotyping (4) concentrations/levels (5) whole genome sequencing iii) Average monthly volume iv) Line speeds v) Incoming product specifications (1) Aerobic Plate Count (APC) load (2) Salmonella prevalence (3) Salmonella subtype vi) Type of laboratory support (e.g., data from accredited lab or whether AOAC-approved methods were used) vii) Process control indicators &#8211; results and consequences of testing for: (1) APC (2) generic E. coli (3) Salmonella (4) other viii) Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) validation and verification ix) Lotting practices x) Bird characteristics (e.g., age, weight, genotypic resistance to Salmonella enteric colonization) Because controls of levels and/or subtypes of Salmonella are possible risk management options, data related to levels or subtypes of Salmonella are especially important. Collaborators should describe what and how much data they will analyze and how they will summarize the data in a form suitable for use as inputs to the risk assessment models. Data sets should be complete. FSIS encourages submissions from applicants who can provide data that are representative of the industry both geographically and seasonally. Ideally data sets would represent large, small and very small establishments. Additionally, collaborators should describe their relationships with the poultry industry (both chicken and turkey), their previous experience collecting and analyzing data, and how they will ensure that data they collect remain confidential. Specifically, the collaborator may include excerpts of information in its research results for the USDA and/or for disclosure in USDA publications, BUT MAY NOT, under any circumstances: (i) identify any retailer or manufacturer, (ii) disclose any retailer-identifiable or manufacturer-identifiable information, including specific brands or product names and/or (iii) disclose any market share data at the retailer, brand, or item level in any market. FSIS understands that the data may be proprietary or viewed as confidential business information. Pursuant to USDA&apos;s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations (7 CFR 1.1 et seq.), FSIS is responsible for making the determination with regard to the disclosure or nondisclosure of information in agency records that has been submitted by a collaborator. When, in the course of responding to a FOIA request, FSIS cannot readily determine whether the information obtained from a person is confidential business information, the Agency will seek to obtain and carefully consider the views of the submitter of the information and provide the submitter an opportunity to object to any decision to disclose the information. FSIS will protect collaborators&#8217; confidential business information from public disclosure to the extent authorized under FOIA and in conformity with USDA&apos;s FOIA regulations. 2) Dose Response: An important part of the risk assessment models described above is how the dose of Salmonella to which people are exposed affects the probability of their becoming ill. In the past, FSIS has used the dose-response relationship developed by the World Health Organization[1] to predict human illnesses. This dose-response relationship, however, is based on combined information for all Salmonella subtypes, with no information on any subtype-specific dose-response. In order to evaluate risk management options that consider the public health impact of controlling one or more specific Salmonella subtypes in poultry, FSIS seeks assistance developing a dose-response methodology that considers differences in virulence among Salmonella subtypes. Applicants should describe their experience in developing dose-response relationships and describe one or more approaches that account for differences in subtype. The collaborator will be expected to develop one or more methodologies for relating risk of illness to subtype- specific doses of Salmonella.

A more immediate goal for each Center is to rapidly advance synergistic, interdisciplinary research programs while serving as local resources and national leaders in ME/CFS research. Successful CRC research programs will facilitate research in ME/CFS through conducting of 1) collaborative basic and/or clinical research on ME/CFS; 2) longitudinal studies of individuals with ME/CFS within each ME/CFS CRC and across CRCs within the network; 3) access to information related to ME/CFS for basic and clinical researchers, academic and practicing physicians, healthcare professionals, patients, and the lay public. Clinical data and biospecimen sharing are required, and data management for efficient data collection and data sharing, as well as biospecimen sharing will be addressed through the separate data management and coordinating center (DMCC). Institutions must be committed to the establishment and continuation of the proposed ME/CFS CRC. Funding decisions will focus on those applications most likely to make highly impactful contributions to ME/CFS research, as well as on those with the greatest potential to collaborate effectively across the ME/CFS CRC program.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The goals of this solicitation are to (i) ensure broad adoption of CI tools, methods, and resources by the research community in order to catalyze major research advances and to enhance researchers&#8217; abilities to lead the development of new CI; (ii) integrate core literacy and discipline-appropriate advanced skills in advanced CI as well as computational and data-driven methods for advancing fundamental research, into the Nation&#8217;s undergraduate and graduate educational curriculum/instructional materials; and (iii) build communities of research CI professional staff to deploy, manage, and collaboratively support the effective use of research CI, as well as establish career paths for those staff within and across institutions and science and engineering (S&amp;E) disciplines. Proposals responding to the Pilot and Implementation project classes defined in this solicitation may target one or both of the first two solicitation goals, while proposals responding to the CIP project class must address the third goal. For the purpose of this solicitation, advanced CI is broadly defined as the set of resources, tools, methods, and services for advanced computation, large-scale data handling and analytics, and networking and security for large-scale systems that collectively enable potentially transformative fundamental S&amp;E research and education. This solicitation calls for innovative, scalable training, education, and curriculum/instructional materials, along with deeper incorporation of CI professionals into the research enterprise&#8212;targeting one or more of the solicitation goals&#8212;to address emerging needs and unresolved bottlenecks in S&amp;E research workforce development, from the postsecondary level to active researchers to CI professionals. The funded activities, spanning targeted, multidisciplinary communities, should lead to transformative changes in the state of research workforce preparedness for advanced CI-enabled research in the short- and long-term. This solicitation also seeks to broaden CI access and adoption by (i) increasing adoption of advanced CI and of computational and data-driven methods to a broader range of S&amp;E disciplines and institutions; (ii) enhancing the incorporation of CI professionals into the research enterprise &#8211; highlighting the value of those professionals in S&amp;E research; and (iii) effectively utilizing the capabilities of individuals from a diverse set of underrepresented groups. Proposals from, and in partnership with, the aforementioned communities are especially encouraged. There are three project classes as defined below: Pilot Projects: up to $300,000 total budget with durations up to two years; Implementation Projects: Small (with total budgets of up to $500,000) or Medium (with total budgets of up to $1,000,000) for durations of up to four years; and CI Professional (CIP) Projects: up to two full-time equivalents (FTEs) per institution and four FTEs total with durations up to five years. Section II. Program Description provides a more complete description of the project classes. Section V.A. Proposal Preparation Instructions describes the proposal elements required for the various project classes in order to address the suitable set of solicitation-specific review criteria. The CyberTraining program is led by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and has participation from other NSF directorates/divisions as described in Section II. Program Description, Programmatic Areas of Interest. Not all directorates/divisions are participating at the same level and some have specific research and education priorities. The appropriate contact for the CyberTraining program in any directorate/division is the Cognizant Program Officer (PO) for the respective directorate/division/office/program listed below. All projects are expected to clearly articulate how they address important community needs, will provide resources that will be widely available to and usable by the research community, and will broaden participation from underrepresented groups. Prospective principal investigators (PIs) are strongly encouraged to contact the Cognizant Program Officers in CISE/OAC and in the participating directorate/division relevant to the proposal to ascertain whether the focus and budget of their proposed activities are appropriate for this solicitation. Such consultations should be completed at least one month in advance of the submission deadline. PIs should include the names of the Cognizant Program Officers consulted in a Single Copy Document as described in Section V.A. Proposal Preparation Instructions. The intent of the CyberTraining program is to encourage collaboration between CI and S&amp;E domain disciplines. (For this purpose, units of CISE other than OAC are considered domain disciplines.) To ensure relevance to community needs and to facilitate adoption, those proposals of interest to one or more domain divisions must include at least one PI/co-PI with expertise relevant to the targeted research discipline. All proposals shall include at least one PI/co-PI with expertise relevant to OAC. Prospective PIs contemplating submissions that primarily target communities relevant to directorates/divisions that are not participating in this solicitation are directed to instead explore the education and workforce development programs of the respective directorates/divisions.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To apply to this FOA, Applicants must register with and submit application materials through ARPA-E eXCHANGE (https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Registration.aspx). For detailed guidance on using ARPA-E eXCHANGE, please refer to the ARPA-E eXCHANGE User Guide (https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Manuals.aspx). ARPA-E will not review or consider concept papers submitted through other means. For problems with ARPA-E eXCHANGE, email ExchangeHelp@hq.doe.gov (with FOA name and number in the subject line). Questions about this FOA? Check the Frequently Asked Questions available at http://arpa-e.energy.gov/faq. For questions that have not already been answered, email ARPA-E-CO@hq.doe.gov. Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). Program Overview: The goal of the HESTIA program is to support the development of technologies that nullify embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Section I.B above), while simultaneously transforming buildings into net carbon storage structures. Specifically, projects funded under the HESTIA Program will develop and demonstrate building materials and whole-building designs that are net carbon negative (see Section I.B above) on a life cycle basis by utilizing atmospheric CO2 or CH4 (see Section I.B above) from a wide range of potential feedstocks (e.g., forestry and purpose-grown products, agricultural residues, marine derived, direct carbon utilization) in the production process. HESTIA metrics are: &#8226; storage of more carbon in the chemical structure of the finished product than emitted during manufacture, construction, and use, &#8226; relevant performance testing (e.g., flammability, strength) as required per applicable building code and incumbent specifications, &#8226; market advantage (e.g., improved material performance in at least one area, lower cost, easier installation) over the best-in-class incumbent building element(s) (i.e. structural and/or enclosure) selected for replacement, and &#8226; sufficient retention of carbon storage over service lifetime and minimized end-of-life emissions where possible by designing for reuse, repurposing, and/or recycling. This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these metrics in a cost-effective manner to meet building construction industry demand for low-cost. Technical categories of interest are identified in Section I.E of the FOA. Performance targets for the technical categories of interest are provided in Section I.F of the FOA. Section I.G of the FOA provides information on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) requirements. To ensure that the technologies developed through this Program are evaluated consistently and transparently, a separate solicitation will be used to develop and perform Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in conjunction with and to support Applicants of this FOA. The HESTIA Program offers a unique opportunity to address the growing need for market-ready negative emission technologies to implement carbon removal strategies by changing the paradigm for building construction through the use of carbon negativity as a design parameter. Projects will create novel designs that maximize the energy benefits of carbon storage in addition to manufacturing methods and performance of the materials themselves.

Section 4724 of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, as amended (16 U.S.C. 4701-4741) (Act), authorized and provided general guidance for the development of State and Interstate Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Management Plans. The Act enables State governors to submit these plans to the ANS Task Force for approval. These comprehensive ANS Management Plans identify technical, enforcement, or financial assistance activities needed to prevent, eliminate, or reduce the environmental and public health and safety risks associated with ANS. ANS Management Plans focus on feasible, cost-effective management practices and measures to be undertaken by States to prevent and control ANS infestations in an environmentally sound manner. Once an ANS Management Plan is reviewed and approved by the ANS Task Force, the Act authorizes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) to provide cost-share grants for the implementation of the approved plans. This Program has a two-stage application process (see sections D2 and E2, for more details). Stage One - the &#8220;Preliminary National Review&#8221; - is managed by the Service Headquarters office. The pre-proposal process will occur outside of Grant Solutions similar to how it has occurred in the past; for 2022, pre-proposals are due four weeks after posting of the NOFO. Stage Two - the &#8220;Regional Office Review and Grant Processing&#8221; - is managed by the Service Regional Offices (See the program administration contacts under section E2 below).</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The program will be implemented as a Cooperative Agreement and will highlight areas of cooperation such as health, education, entrepreneurship, women&apos;s empowerment, law enforcement and security, energy, infrastructure, and other areas of collaboration. The program is designed to use documentary-style personal interest stories to inform the Somali public about: 1) how U.S. civilian assistance is contributing to Somalia&#8217;s stability, prosperity, and self-reliance; and 2) how, working in cooperation with Somalia&#8217;s leaders, international donors, and development partners, U.S. assistance has supported Somalia&#8217;s efforts to spur trade and economic growth, strengthen the rule of law, foster civil society, promote people-to-people ties, and fight infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, as well as the direct impact of related programs. The program will produce 24 30-minute episodes prepared in a documentary style focusing on specific sectors and U.S. Embassy programs chosen in consultation with the Grants Officer and the Grants Officer Representative. The radio programs and podcast will aim to broaden understanding about the multi-faceted U.S.-Somali partnership. This program&#8217;s direct target audience is Somali communities whose primary source of information is local radio. The secondary audience is members of the Somali public active on social media. Proposals must cover a one-year period of performance. Review the Notice of Funding Opportunity for a complete list of requirements. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Priority Region: Japan Program Objectives: Every year, the U.S. government selects individuals from around the world representing a variety of fields with different levels of experience to participate in a variety of different U.S. government programs. Individuals learn and network their American interlocutors, as well as from other program participants from around the world. During and immediately after programs, participants are often energized to build on what they have learned; however, as time passes, that energy abates. The Embassy welcomes proposals that seek innovative and creative ways to revitalize Japanese alumni enthusiasm, rekindling the sentiment they had immediately after returning to Japan upon the completing of their exchange program(s). Furthermore, the proposal should detail a specific social issue(s) the alumni can address, explain the approaches that are being implemented to solve this issue(s), and highlight the program&#8217;s impact, effectiveness, and future sustainability. The proposal must also contain an element that focuses on the collaborative efforts between the U.S. and Japan. The Embassy is particularly interested in supporting the following priority areas: - Strengthen U.S. Department of State ties to Japanese alumni by offering opportunities to allow them to expand upon their exchange experiences and use the skills they developed abroad to address shared global challenges. - Provide Japanese alumni with information, resources, and networks to allow them to leverage skills and experiences gained through their exchanges to prosper in a globalized world and marketplace. - Support alumni-driven initiatives that address international issues of common concern and promote mutual understanding between the United States and Japan. - Reinforce existing alumni program identities and build a sense of common identity among past participants of U.S. government-sponsored exchange programs. All programs must include an American element, such as a connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s in a specific field that will promote increased understanding of U.S. policy and perspectives, or discussions by Japanese speakers regarding their experience in the United States. And in order to promote collaboration and alumni networking building, projects should be submitted by teams of at least two alumni, with the &#8220;team lead&#8221; being a Japanese citizen alumnus/a to Public Affairs Section, U.S. Embassy Tokyo. Project activities should take place in Japan and should multiply the effects of participants&#8217; exchange experience by positively impacting communities in Japan. All programs must engage Japanese audiences. Programs may take place in person or virtually (note: due to current COVID travel restrictions, all applications should include a plan for virtual engagement). If you apply from outside of Japan, we highly recommend potential applicants to collaborate and coordinate with project partners in Japan to implement requested programs successfully. The applicant should budget for interpretation and translation. Participants and Audiences: The Embassy will only consider grants that involve Japanese alumni of U.S. government (USG) program audiences. Applicants should be either Japanese USG Sponsored Exchange Alumni Organizations, who have already created an organization prior to applying for the NOFO with a minimum of two [2] alumni (one of who is the team leader), or organizations whose projects focus on U.S. Government-sponsored exchange program alumni. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division). Instructions are at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/library-and-useful-links (link from the words due date calendar). </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Alumni awards should be keyed to the following priority areas: 1) U.S.-Japan Security Alliance and Indo-Pacific Multilateral Security cooperation 2) Environment and Sustainability 3) Women&#8217;s Economic Empowerment 4) Innovation This award program will serve to 1) promote the Fulbright program itself; 2) increase the number and diversity of Japanese applicants; and 3) generate increase interest among the Japanese public for the Fulbright program. These Fulbright &#8220;Heroes&#8221; will also be featured in a short video that we can use for recruitment purposes. This is meant to highlight the ways the Fulbright program helps to advance Mission priorities. Priority Region:&#8239;Japan Program Objectives: As we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Fulbright Program in Japan and the 75th anniversary of the program&#8217;s inception in the United States in 2021-2022, it is both an opportune time to reflect on the accomplishments of Fulbright alumni contributing to a variety of fields in Japan, and look to the future of the U.S. government&apos;s flagship people-to-people exchange program. This proposed program will award several prominent Fulbrighters with an &#8220;Ambassador&#8217;s Award.&#8221; The selected grantee will collect information on the alumni, showcase their contributions to the U.S.-Japan relationship, and then publicize the awards. All programs must include an American element, such as a connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s in a specific field that will promote increased understanding of U.S. policy and perspectives, or discussions by Japanese speakers regarding their experience in the United States. Project activities should take place in Japan and should multiply the effects of participants&#8217; exchange experience by positively impacting communities in Japan. Participants and Audiences: All programs must engage Japanese audiences, with a focus on the U.S.-Japan Fulbright program. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This program may also be used as part of the 70th anniversary celebration of IVLP in Japan. The Embassy welcomes innovative and creative program models that move beyond to conference/workshop model. Priority Region:&#8239;Japan Program Objectives: The International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), the Department of State&#8217;s premier professional exchange initiative for emerging leaders, fosters mutual understanding and develop cultural and professional connections. The program has over 225,000 alumni worldwide. In Japan, the program started in 1953. Currently there are more than 3,800 IVLP alumni, and notable alumni include Nobel Laureate Kenzaburo Oe; former prime ministers Naoto Kan, Yukio Hatoyama, Toshiki Kaifu, and Morihiro Hosokawa; novelist Haruki Murakami; Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike; and Showa Women&#8217;s University Chancellor Mariko Bando. In 2023, IVLP will celebrate its 70th anniversary in Japan. In Japan, IVLP alumni account for 40% of the USG exchange program alumni population. However, it has also been a challenge to engage IVLP alumni, as they often do not identify as USG alumni. This is a major challenge for IVLP alumni engagement at U.S. Embassy Tokyo. The Embassy welcomes proposals that, by addressing a specific social issue, bring IVLP alumni together for a capacity building opportunity. The proposal should also include opportunities that allow for: 1) Enhancing participants&#8217; English language skills to enable them to share their IVLP experiences in the U.S., 2) Encouraging alumni to highlight their IVLP experience to professionally and 3) Networking with like-minded peers, specifically other IVLP alumni, other USG alumni, and other interested groups. The proposal should also detail the specific social issue(s) being addressed, explain the approaches that are being implemented to solve these issues, and highlight its impact, effectiveness, and future sustainability. The proposal must also contain an element that focuses on the collaborative efforts between the U.S. and Japan.

The pandemic also accentuated long-standing weaknesses and created new challenges to the U.S. public health infrastructure. Public health departments and other public health partners need to continue their work to respond to COVID-19 and prepare for other public health emergencies that arise in the future. Moreover, COVID-19 has affected nearly every aspect of healthcare and public health, laying bare disparities and gaps in some conditions and worsening others. Public health agencies need the capacity to regain their footing in these areas and then accelerate their efforts. This funding is a first of its kind, non-categorical and cross-cutting programs, intended to help meet critical infrastructure and workforce needs in the short-term; and it should also make possible strategic investments that will have lasting effects on public health agencies across the United States. To that end, it will support strategically strengthening public health capacity and systems related to the workforce, foundational capabilities, data modernization, physical infrastructure and support from national public health partners. Component A of the grant may focus on public health infrastructure (i.e., workforce, foundational capabilities, data modernization, and physical infrastructure) while Component B may focus on how National Public Health Partners can provide technical assistance and evaluation support to Component A recipients. In the workforce area, infrastructure needs include adding new staff, retaining existing staff, better addressing staff wellness, providing more and better training and professional development opportunities, and improving systems and capacity related to workforce development and management. Maximum flexibility will be provided to the recipients to contract with any organization deemed appropriate to accomplish the goal of expanding the public health workforce in jurisdictions. There will be no restrictions on the types of positions that can be hired. Investments and improvements to data systems (I.e., Data Modernization Initiative) will serve to improve efficiency and effectiveness of those organizations&#8217; operations and public health work, including their ability to partner in a complex health and health care environment. Similarly, other investments and improvements to foundational capabilities, including physical infrastructure, will help modernize public health agencies and position them to be even better service providers and partners. These outcomes will lead to public health services being expanded, improved, and accelerated, and in turn public health outcomes including COVID-19 will be better addressed. The cornerstone of all this work will be demonstrating and improving the health department&apos;s ability to advance health equity and address health disparities for populations at higher risk and in medically underserved communities. Across areas, this should be part of a transformation of public health agencies needed to meet the evolving and complex needs of the U.S. population. This transformation will not only involve improvements and changes to public health internal systems and operations; it will also involve repositioning public health entities within the larger health and health care systems in which they operate. This will necessarily involve creating and strengthening partnerships at all levels. This program will also help to address the historic underinvestment in communities that are economically or socially marginalized, rural communities, and communities with people from racial and ethnic minority groups. This program also should support larger efforts to rebalance these investments and serve communities and populations that deserve more and better public health services. Some parts referred to as strategies in this NOFO may be approved but unfunded (ABU) contingent upon the availability of funding and stipulations of appropriations. All recipients will receive workforce funding under Component A and recipients of Component B will also be funded. All awards are subject to availability of funds.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Under this program, the Service provides matching grants to States in support of land acquisition projects that will conserve species habitat in perpetuity through fee simple acquisition or the acquisition of permanent conservation easements. The Service considers the use of Federal acquisition dollars by States for habitat protection associated with HCPs to be an important and effective mechanism to promote species recovery, prevent extinction, and preclude the need to list species under the ESA in the future. All land acquired through these grants complements, but does not replace, the mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring commitments of the HCP. Thus, this work is additive to the conservation commitments entered into when HCPs are permitted and serves as a meaningful way to leverage non-Federal investment in species recovery and connect conservation lands across the landscape.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Please carefully follow all instructions below. Priority Region: Project activities must take place in Kenya and the United States and be directed at Kenyan high school students. Program Objectives: The grantee will work in coordination with the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s Education Outreach Coordinator and the EducationUSA Advisor grantee in Nairobi in support of the EducationUSA Opportunity Funds program. This program assists highly qualified students who are likely to be awarded full financial aid from U.S. colleges and universities but lack the financial resources to cover the up-front costs of required standardized admission tests, application fees, international and domestic airfare, visa fees, SEVIS fees, and settling-in allowance. The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi will select the EducationUSA adviser who will and the EducationUSA adviser will advise the Opportunity Funds students. This program supports the U.S. Embassy objectives to achieve inclusive, market-driven, environmentally sustainable economic growth, strengthen health and human capacity, and advance new activities that promote trade, economic cooperation, and legitimate travel.Individuals and institutions interested in bidding on this cooperative agreement are asked to submit a proposal to administer the Opportunity Funds program, EducationUSA student assistant stipend disbursement, and coordination of the Phase I Orientation, College Application Boot Camp to take place in June and July 2022 and the Phase II Graduation and Pre-Departure Orientation to take place in July 2022. The successful grantee will demonstrate an ability to effectively handle funds, coordinate logistics, and finalize payments in a timely manner. The grantee must have an international credit card to which SAT registration fees can be charged. Key Program Components:Opportunity Funds Program Phase IIn the first phase, the Opportunity Funds scholarship will pay for approximately 40 students to take the SAT, SAT subject tests, and/or the ACT. The grantee will arrange payment and registration for these tests. The estimated scholarship amount for phase one is $110 per student. The institution will manage the logistics of test registration for each student and will oversee that students take the test on various test dates at various testing centers in Kenya. It is expected that students will take the tests between May and July 2022Opportunity Funds Program Phase II In the second phase, the Opportunity Funds scholarship will pay for at least 12 students to travel to the United States to matriculate at a U.S. institution of higher education. The scholarship will pay for visa and SEVIS fees, required immunizations, international airfare, domestic airfare (if required), and a settling-in allowance (if required). The estimated scholarship amount for phase two is approximately $2,200 per student. The institution will communicate with the students and EducationUSA adviser, coordinate visa appointments, make travel arrangements for domestic and international travel, and coordinate payment to the students of settling-in and other related allowances. Phase II students will receive admission decisions between December 2021 and April 2022 and will need to be ready to start classes in the United States with start dates from July to September 2022.Student StipendThe grantee will manage monthly stipend payments to students who will assist the EducationUSA adviser in the implementation of the programmatic aspects of EducationUSA. The EducationUSA adviser will select two qualified students who have previously participated in the EducationUSA scholars&#8217; program to help administer the required training for new scholars. The grantee will disburse a monthly stipend of $200 per month per student to offset travel expenses.Boot Camp and Pre-Departure OrientationThe grantee will manage the logistics of a College Application Boot Camp to take place in July 2022 for at least 60 students. This will be five consecutive days of activities for students preparing their college applications to study in the United States. The institution will coordinate in-country travel for all students and provide a venue, meals, refreshments, lodging, material reproduction services, and supplies and stationery. Proposals should also include plans in case the boot camp must be held virtually instead of in-person.The grantee will also manage the logistics of a Pre-Departure Orientation to take place in July 2022 in Nairobi, for three consecutive days for at least 12 students, although likely more.

According to the DD Act, Sec. 101. [42 USC 15001] c Policy. &#8220;It is the policy of the United States that all programs receiving assistance under this title shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the principles that Services, supports, and other assistance should be provided that demonstrate respect for personal preferences, and cultural differences; Specific efforts must be made to ensure that individuals with developmental disabilities from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and their families enjoy increased and meaningful opportunities to access and use community services, individualized supports available to other individuals with developmental disabilities and their families; Recruitment efforts in disciplines related to developmental disabilities in pre-service training, community training, practice, administration, and Policymaking must focus on bringing larger numbers of racial and ethnic minorities into the disciplines in order to provide appropriate skills, knowledge, role models, and sufficient personnel to address the growing needs of an increasingly diverse population.&#8221; The DD Act has long identified the importance of cultural competence and improving expectations and outcomes for people with developmental disabilities, including those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The DD Act throughout requires that the programs authorized address the needs of people from unserved and underserved backgrounds. Section 101(a) identifies the need to ensure that services, supports, and other assistance are provided in a culturally competent manner and that individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds are fully included in all activities provided under the Act. The term &#8220;culturally competent&#8221; is defined in the DD Act of 2000, sec. 102(7) as: Services, supports, or other assistance that is conducted or provided in a manner that is responsive to the beliefs, interpersonal styles, attitudes, language, and behaviors of individuals who are receiving the services, supports, or other assistance, and in a manner that has the greatest likelihood of ensuring their maximum participation in the program involved. The DD Act of 2000 recognizes the important role that UCEDDs play in enhancing the diversity of the workforce, requiring that UCEDDs coordinate their efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented groups at all levels in order to respond to the changing United States demographics. This opportunity will fund up to 10 UCEDD Diversity fellowship grants to continue to address the disparities experienced by historically underrepresented communities. Funds will be used to support the recruitment and retention of trainees from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to participate in a fellowship experience at the UCEDD with opportunities to make systemic change through a capstone project in community based activities. AoD will award NTI grants to pay for the federal share of a diversity fellowship program to support UCEDDs in: Growing the diversity of its trainee enrollment; Building a cohort of trainees in the UCEDD network from diverse backgrounds; Creating a forum for knowledge exchange and transfer at the UCEDD; and Committing to participate in an AUCD coordinated national forum for knowledge exchange and transfer across the UCEDD network. The UCEDD will use the funds to recruit at least one trainee from a diverse background to participate in a fellowship program with opportunities to make systemic change through a capstone project in community-based activities, organizations, policy and/or programs. The fellowship should include a formal training experience with mentoring and other opportunities that will engage the trainee in the national network of UCEDDs and support knowledge exchange and transfer in a national forum.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Failure to meet the eligibility criteria by the application deadline may result in exclusion from consideration or, preclude NIFA from making an award. For those new to Federal financial assistance, NIFA&#8217;s Grants Overview provides highly recommended information about grants and other resources to help understand the Federal awards process. Only the following are eligible to apply: Land-grant institutions, Colleges and universities having significant minority enrollments and a demonstrable capacity to carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences; and other colleges and universities having a demonstrable capacity to carry out the teaching of food, and agricultural sciences. Research foundations maintained by an eligible college or university are eligible to submit graduate training proposals under this RFA. Award recipients may subcontract to organizations not eligible to apply provided such organizations are necessary for the conduct of the project. Failure to meet an eligibility criterion by the application deadline may result in the application being excluded from consideration or, even though an application may be reviewed, will preclude NIFA from making an award. Applicants should be institutions that confer a graduate degree in at least one of the TESAs listed in Part I of this RFA. Awards are made to eligible colleges and universities. Individuals are not eligible to apply for these grants to support their graduate education. Successful applications must select and identify Fellows and award Fellowships within eighteen (18) months of the start date of a grant. Post-doctoral Fellowships will not be awarded under this grant announcement. 1. Institutions that fail to meet this deadline will be required to refund monies associated with unawarded Fellowships to NIFA. 2. Graduate fellowship appointments must be awarded only to registered students who are pursuing full-time study in graduate programs in the TESA and at the degree level supported by the grant. 3. Applicants may not request partial fellowships. A USDA Fellow at the master&#8217;s degree level who maintains satisfactory progress is eligible to receive grant support for a maximum of twenty-four (24) months during a thirty (30) month period. A USDA Fellow at the doctoral degree level who maintains satisfactory progress is eligible to receive grant support for a maximum of thirty-six (36) months within a forty-two (42) month period. It is the intent of this program that Graduate Fellows pursue full-time uninterrupted study or thesis/dissertation research, including time spent pursuing USDA-funded special international study or thesis/dissertation research activities. Graduate Fellows in academic institutions are not entitled to regular annual leave but are entitled to the normal student holidays observed by the institution. The time between academic semesters or quarters is to be utilized as an active part of the grant period. During the period of support, USDA Graduate Fellows, at the discretion of their institutions, may accept additional supplemental employment that would positively contribute to their training or research and would make them eligible for tuition waivers (e.g., full, or partial tuition waivers with research or teaching assignments). A Graduate Fellow who finds it necessary to interrupt his/her program of study because of health, personal, or other reasonable non-academic and non-disciplinary cause(s) must be allowed to resume funded study at any time within 6 months of the interruption, provided there is adequate time remaining before the award expires (i.e., within the 30-month total funding period for a master&#8217;s Fellow, and 42-month total funding period for a Doctoral Fellow).

We are the only agency in the federal government whose primary responsibility is the conservation and management of these important natural resources for the American public. The Service&apos;s origins date back to 1871 when Congress established the U.S. Fish Commission to study the decrease in the nation&#8217;s food fishes and recommend ways to reverse that decline. Today, we are a diverse and largely decentralized organization, employing about 8,000 dedicated professionals working out of facilities across the country, including a headquarters office in Falls Church, Virginia, and eight regional offices representing the 12 Unified Interior Regions. The National Infrastructure Partnerships initiative of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) encourages National Wildlife Refuge System field stations to partner with local, regional, and national nonprofit organizations, other land management groups, state and tribal partners, and others to accomplish projects that: (i) promote the stewardship of resources of the refuge through habitat maintenance, restoration, and improvement, biological monitoring, or research; (ii) support the operation and maintenance of the refuge through constructing, operating, maintaining, or improving the facilities and services of the refuge; (iii) increase awareness and understanding of the refuge and the National Wildlife Refuge System through the development, publication, or distribution of educational materials and products; (iv) advance education concerning the purposes of the refuge and the mission of the System through the use of the refuge as an outdoor classroom to combine educational curricula with the personal experiences of students relating to fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitat and to the cultural and historical resources of the refuges and development of other educational programs; (v) promote the understanding of, education relating to, and the conservation of the fish, wildlife, plants, and cultural and historical resources; (vi) improve scientific literacy. The goals of the initiative are to enable local communities to play a more active role in increasing outdoor recreation opportunities on refuge lands and waters, to be more focused and deliberate in using partnerships to help the Service address infrastructure repair and improvement needs such as proactive maintenance and the maintenance backlog, and to enhance wildlife habitat. This initiative will enable the Service to leverage funds and staff resources. Additionally, this initiative can help address multiple Service priorities as a catalyst for: &#8226; Economic and Conservation Enhancement &#8226; Career Training and Mentoring Opportunities for Youth and Adults &#8226; Equity and Inclusion in Conservation and Recreation &#8226; Climate and Wildlife Resilience &#8226; Community Health Successful projects will be research/assessments related to identified Service priorities or infrastructure projects at national wildlife refuges that enhance the visitor experience, promote wildlife-dependent outdoor recreation, provide sustainable wildlife habitat, provide career training and mentoring opportunities, and engage the community in special events and other opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent outdoor recreation on Service lands and waters. Fish and Wildlife Act &#8211; Community Partnership Enhancement Authority Overview Notwithstanding the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act, the Fish and Wildlife Act&#8212;Community partnership enhancement (16 U.S.C. 742f(d)) authorizes the Service to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal partner entities to implement projects or programs for a refuge or complex of geographically related refuges , including carrying out certain construction projects on refuge property. For the purposes of this Act, projects include &#8220;constructing, operating, maintaining, or improving the facilities&#8221;. However, there are several restrictions that apply to the special authority, including restrictions on partner administrative and operational costs and property ownership. &#8226; This authority is only available to the National Wildlife Refuge System. &#8226; Improvements become the property of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. &#8226; Federal funds may not exceed non-Federal matching funds. &#8226; Per the Fish and Wildlife Act &#8211; Community Partnership Enhancement Authority, the Service cannot provide funding under this program for non-Federal entity operation or administration costs (i.e, indirect costs): &#8220;(ii) Use of Federal funds - Any Federal funds used to fund a project or program under a cooperative agreement may be used only for expenses directly related to the project or program and may not be used for operation or administration of any non-Federal entity.&#8221; </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Updated Contact Information</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This barrier is exacerbated by limited opportunities to gain such familiarity. To help provide technical assistance to build capacity and achieve the goal of broadening institutional participation, this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) will provide seed funding for institutions to: 1) develop new partnerships with other academic institutions and/or national laboratories to enable future participation in EESSD-relevant research; 2) facilitate participation in planned EESSD research programmatic and user facility outreach and training activities; and 3) foster the development of climate and environmental science research and training capacity at under-represented institutions. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To accomplish this, NHTSA awards grants to state and local governments, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities in support of motor vehicles and road traffic safety initiatives.NHTSA is committed to addressing equity in traffic safety, with respect to development and implementation of programs and objectives described in this NOFO consistent with Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.The purpose of the Cooperative Agreement (CA or Agreement) is to advance traffic safety through the development, demonstration, and evaluation of innovative traffic safety countermeasure approaches and techniques, and innovative and measurable strategies and programs to affect law enforcement engagement. Traffic fatalities are increasing at a significant rate and new traffic safety countermeasures are required to address the rise in fatalities. The Recipient will first develop and demonstrate innovative traffic safety strategies and approaches consistent with existing legislation, that also support the fair and equitable application of countermeasures in communities of color, socio-economically disadvantaged, or locations where enforcement has been ineffective or lacking as a localized priority. The Recipient shall also demonstrate and evaluate approaches, strategies, and methods that enhance law enforcement engagement, as well as public engagement between law enforcement and the communities being served, ensuring that underserved communities are represented. The project will focus on the following:1. Speed management and speeding enforcement.2. Occupant protection, including seat belts and child restraint enforcement. 3. Impaired driving enforcement. 4. Effective engagement between Highway Safety Offices and law enforcementSince 2015, the Nation experienced a significant and sudden increase in the number of highway traffic fatalities after steadily declining to the lowest level in more than 65 years in 2014. In 2015, the Nation experienced a nearly 10 percent increase in traffic deaths and increased to a high point in 2020 at 38,680 fatalities. Improving safety on our Nation&#8217;s roadways and preventing injuries and deaths in traffic crashes remains a top priority for NHTSA. Pursuant to its authority, NHTSA provides highway traffic safety grants to states, territories and local communities, and supports research, demonstration projects, and countermeasure programs designed to prevent motor vehicle crashes and reduce their associated economic costs. The development of new approaches and strategies to influence action by law enforcement to undertake the action necessary to reduce crashes and fatalities has become evident. Existing programs and strategies are not having the desired effect in an environment where fatal crashes are increasing significantly, and societal expectations and changes have challenged law enforcement at the operational and philosophical level. Injuries due to speeding, occupant protection and impaired driving are key components in the surge of fatalities, as well as the disproportional impact on communities of color. To address the recent rise in traffic fatalities, NHTSA seeks innovative approaches to enforcement and community engagement to bring down the number of people killed on our roads and highways every year. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The MFP demonstration, originally authorized under section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), has played a key role in many states&#8217; LTSS rebalancing efforts under the Medicaid program. MFP provides flexible funding opportunities to help states to develop and test the necessary processes, tools, and infrastructure to advance LTSS system reform and to support successful transitions from institutional to community-based settings for individuals eligible for Medicaid LTSS. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA), Congress authorized an additional $1.253 billion in federal funds for the MFP demonstration project and extended the project through federal fiscal year (FY) 2023. The CAA also provided CMS with authorization to expand the MFP demonstration project to additional states and territories. Currently, there are thirty-four (34) states, including the District of Columbia, participating in the MFP demonstration project. The MFP Demonstration Expansion Project focuses on states and territories not currently participating in the MFP Demonstration Project. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will make funds available for a Planning Phase with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2022. Based on the anticipated successful performance of the Planning Phase, a recipient is eligible for Program Implementation and HCBS Transitions Phase funding. Award recipients will begin with an approximately 18-month Planning Phase during which they will work with stakeholders to design and develop an MFP demonstration project that supports the states&#8217; unique LTSS system reform goals. Award recipients will also have the opportunity to implement capacity building initiatives during and after the end of the Planning Phase. Funding requests are available for planning and capacity building for an amount up to $5 million per state. Funding will be available for the year in which it is awarded and four additional years. Prior to the application deadline, CMS will hold two webinars to provide details about the MFP Demonstration Project, and to answer questions from potential applicants regarding this funding opportunity. Information about the webinars will be posted on the MFP Demonstration Project website at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/long-term-services-supports/money-follows-person/index.html.

The response provides a unique opportunity to review, evaluate, and recommend strategies to prevent and to rapidly respond to the introduction, establishment, and spread of AIS in the waters of the United States. Accordingly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or Service) requests proposals to conduct an assessment and draft an after-action report for the Marimo moss ball incident that is national in scope to evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of actions taken and provide recommendations for future actions needed to mitigate risk and improve preparedness for response. It is anticipated that the work will be completed through a cooperative agreement with the Service. Service staff will be substantially involved throughout the assessment to provide details about the response, to provide additional points of contact, and access to additional documents that may be needed to adequately assess the moss ball response. However, it is expected that the grantee will draft the report and develop conclusions and recommendations independently. Objectives to be addressed under this assessment include: Establish the timeline of actions taken to respond to the Marimo moss ball incident; Describe the roles and responsibilities of applicable Federal agencies, including interaction with state agencies and industry sectors; Evaluate the working relationship among Federal agencies at ports of entry; Identify potential obstacles to effective import regulation at the Federal level associated with the commerce of aquatic organisms known to be associated with the aquarium, water garden, and pet trade; Evaluate information sharing (timing, mechanisms, and content) between and among the multiple parties (e.g., Federal and State agencies, industry sectors, businesses, public) involved throughout the response; and Identify potential strengths, gaps, and limitations of the Federal response. Following award selection, the successful applicant must provide a draft outline of the report that will be used to communicate the results of the assessment. A Review Team, composed of Service staff and invited subject matter experts will review the draft outline and provide feedback to ensure that all anticipated deliverables will be met. Overall, the report should: Summarize the manner and timing of actions that occurred to respond to the moss ball incident, including those taken by Federal and State agencies, regional organizations, and industry; Identify gaps in regulation, enforcement, and other authorities, commenting on changes that may be needed to prevent similar circumstances; Provide recommendations for actions needed to: Mitigate risk from the aquarium, water garden, and pet trade prior to, at the point of entry, and after entry into U.S. commerce; Improve preparedness for response to AIS introductions; and Address other issues identified through the analysis. Following the completion of the draft outline, the grantee will be required to meet with the Review Team, either in person or virtually, to discuss a defined work plan and identify areas where assistance or information is needed for the assessment. Six months after the agreed upon work plan is implemented, the grantee must provide an accomplishment report (approximately 2 pages) to update the Review Team on the plan&#8217;s progress. Outcomes from this assessment will be directly applicable to preventing species from being introduced into and spreading within the United States with a focus on pathways associated with the commerce of living organisms, including the aquarium, water garden, and pet trade which are identified as high-risk pathways of introduction. Once the assessment is complete, the grantee will be required to present (30 &#8211; 45 minutes, in person or virtually) the findings and recommendations to the Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Task Force. Recommendations from the report will also be shared through existing forums (e.g., the ANS Task Force, National Invasive Species Council, North American Invasive Species Management Association, National Invasive Species Awareness Week).</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This program supports the development of the country&apos;s democratic institutions and civil society by competitively awarding small grants to nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and associations, to nonprofit civil society organizations (CSOs), and to independent local media organizations in Turkmenistan. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit joint proposals with another NGO, such as a regional NGO collaborating with a Ashgabat-based organization, to build partnerships and strengthen civil society capacity. Background: The Public Affairs Section (PAS) of the U.S. Embassy in Turkmenistan is soliciting Statements of Interest for grants from Turkmen civil society and independent media organizations that focus on one of the priority areas/themes specified below. Applicants should pay close attention to PAS priority goals, program areas, target audiences, and geographic location when developing their proposals. Statements of Interest, including the short budget proposal, cannot exceed three pages. Note: A specific goal and objectives for each theme are listed below. Please ensure you pay close attention to each of the goals, objectives, and target audiences when developing your proposal. Priority Themes: 1. Non-governmental organizations (NGO) capacity buildingThe Turkmen NGO sector is limited, and many NGOs lack essential capacities, especially in rural areas, that limit their impact. The registration process is opaque, complex, and difficult to navigate. Previous PAS-funded projects have focused on empowering cooperation between local governments and civil society, strengthening advocacy efforts and raising awareness on universal human rights, especially among vulnerable and marginalized populations. This funding opportunity seeks to promote more inclusive and accountable democracy by addressing specific current challenges: &#9679; limited knowledge of the importance of the rule of law, civic engagement, civil society, and advocacy; &#9679; limited CSO capacity in strategic planning, project design and management, monitoring and evaluation, public relations and organizational communications, building partnerships, and organizational and financial sustainability, especially in rural areas; and/or &#9679; limited cooperation between rural civil society and local government. Project Goal: Create strong, representative, and independent civil society organizations to hold government and all institutions accountable, deter corruption, and increased CSO capacity to respond to social needs in Turkmenistan. Project Audience(s): Potential and current urban and rural NGOs, including youth organizations, rural youth and university students aged 14-28, their families and community leaders, local and state government officials. Project Objectives (Project proposals may address one or more of these objectives. While these numbers are suggestions, grantees may select different targets as they see fit.) Within 12 months: 1) Increase the number of institutions engaged in the civil society sector that report making positive organizational changes. 2) Increase awareness of the importance of civil society career opportunities among at least 60 secondary school students or university students through activities like debate, advocacy, speaker programs, and rule of law and leadership programs 3) Promote sustainable civic education practices, engagement, and leadership involving a minimum of 60 high school students so that youth more actively and positively participate in civic, social and economic life and contribute to the development of their families and communities through long-term partnerships with governing bodies and local civil society organizations; 4) Increase opportunities for youth decision-making and contribution to governance through supporting at least 7 regional youth leadership initiatives on environmental challenges and/or governmental accountability implemented with local self-governments and local councils; 5) Improve access to public services in rural communities through strengthened partnership between civil society and local government bodies to support the needs of underserved communities; 6) Establish robust communication plans and strategies for at least 8 rural (or relatively low-capacity) CSOs to improve their skills utilizing traditional and social media for outreach campaigns, in support of program goals; and/or 7) Engage a minimum of 8 rural NGOs working with youth, women, and other underserved groups to develop better connectivity with each other and with local government bodies, as well as better-formulated strategies resulting from associated networking and mentoring programs. 2. Advancing Human Capacity and EntrepreneurshipThe economy of Turkmenistan relies heavily on external factors, contributing to the country&#8217;s economic instability in recent decades. The limited economic opportunities and high level of poverty, especially in rural locations, led to mass labor migration, which caused additional socio-economic problems within communities. The pandemic has presented further economic challenges. The ability to speak and read English is an important first step to improve economic opportunity for individuals in Turkmenistan because it increases access to key information and opportunities in higher education, business, trade, and a host of other fields. In addition to English language, it is essential to enhance entrepreneurship skills to expand economic opportunity and secure economic independence, particularly for vulnerable populations. Previous PAS-funded projects have focused on strengthening English language, academic preparation and alumni development initiatives by providing beneficiaries with necessary tools and knowledge; increasing the level of financial literacy and business skills; and providing English-related training programs and vocational courses to ensure economic independence and self-sustainability. This funding opportunity seeks to continue to support projects that strengthen the enabling environment for economic growth by addressing specific current challenges: &#9679; high level of poverty in rural locations; &#9679; insufficient number of academic slots in Turkmenistan; &#9679; lack of English skills to successfully matriculate into U.S. universities; &#9679; lack of core competencies and skills needed in the modern workplace; and/or, &#9679; lack of economic opportunities and resources. Project Goal: To support socio- economic empowerment of youth in Turkmenistan through educational and professional development opportunities Project Audience(s): Youth and university students aged 14-28, their families and community leaders, local and state government officials, alumni and underserved and vulnerable populations, especially in rural regions. Project Objectives (Project proposals may address one or more of these objectives. While these numbers are suggestions, grantees may select different targets as they see fit.) Within 12 months: 1) To strengthen English language skills and academic prep for at least 80 recent high school graduates (ages 17-21) to successfully enter university and create future economic opportunities. 2) Increase knowledge, skills, and available tools for at least 50 secondary high school students or university students through activities like debate, advocacy, speaker programs, entrepreneurship and leadership programs, 3) Increase capacity of at least 20 young women and men (age 18-28) from rural communities to improve entrepreneurship skills through providing training, mentorship support and/or internship with local companies; 4) Improve understanding of sustainable business practices through mentorship/speakers/exchange programs for at least 30 youth (ages 18-28) and small business owners to learn and apply innovative approaches in sustainable business development; 5) Increase awareness of at least 50 potential youth entrepreneurs on ways to use online digital resources or other new resources to promote their businesses through hands-on training.

Questions about this FOA? Check the Frequently Asked Questions available at http://arpa-e.energy.gov/faq. For questions that have not already been answered, email ARPA-E-CO@hq.doe.gov. Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221;1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)2 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The Mining Innovations for Negative Emissions Resource Recovery (MINER) program&#8217;s aim is to support the development of commercial-ready technologies that give the United States a net-zero or net negative emissions pathway toward increased domestic supplies of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and other critical elements required for the transition to clean energy. The lack of a secure domestic supply of these minerals poses a significant supply chain risk for the United States, especially with regard to batteries, renewable energy generation, and transmission. Meanwhile, the domestic mining industry faces the rapid depletion of high-profit deposits, increased cost of mining and processing, expensive, management, and accumulation of tailings, resulting in an overall reduced return of investment by conventional mining methods. Consequently, the Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA&#8211;E) is issuing this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) with objectives to support the development of technology and approaches to: (1) decrease comminution energy by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; (2) increase yield of energy-relevant minerals by reducing unrecovered energy-relevant minerals in the tailings by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; and (3) enabling the negative emissions production of key minerals by sequestering &gt;10 wt.% CO2e per metric ton of ore processed. Four categories have been identified as necessary to achieve these goals and are discussed in detail later: I. Mineral comminution II. Improvements to beneficiation and processing to increase mineral yield III. Carbon negative reactions IV. Sensing, analyzing and enabling carbonation potential and mineralization This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these goals cost-effectively with the potential to reach commercial scalability. Identified within this FOA are technical categories of interest in Section I.F. Also provided within this FOA are performance targets for the technical categories of interest in Section I.G. Lastly, Sections I.H and I.I of the FOA provide information on technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) requirements, respectively.

High Fidelity Radio Frequency Scene Generation for Real-Time Processing NSWC Crane seeks novel approaches to the problem of generating complex radio frequency (RF) scenes for use in real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) simulations. Of particular interest are synthetic RF scenes for navigation purposes such as terrain feature mapping radars, Doppler mapping radars, and object identification purposes within radar scenes generated by pulse-doppler radars and synthetic aperture radars. RF scenes generated by radars such as LIDAR are of interest as well. For HWIL applications, an RF scene is a synthetic scene derived from terrain databases such as Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), merged with three dimensional objects (scatterers), combined with an aerospace vehicle&#8217;s state (3 dimensional position, orientation, and 3 dimensional velocity), and presented as digital scenes suitable for conversion to RF signals for processing in real time by RF systems on the aerospace vehicle. Scene computation approaches should trade scene resolution and fidelity with computation time and effort for a given computing capability. Novel approaches can include precomputation of scenes given apriority knowledge on an aerospace vehicle&#8217;s state over a given timeframe. Precomputation approaches should focus on minimizing scene computation and storage while preserving the ability to present those scenes in real time to a system under test. Aerospace vehicle expected velocities may range from subsonic to hypersonic speeds. A suitable proposal will address at least one of the areas discussed above and show improvement over current state of the art. b. Validation &amp; Verification for Trusted Autonomous Vehicles NSWC Crane seeks research concerning Validation &amp; Verification (V&amp;V) of autonomous vehicles that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. A primary area of exploration involves the evaluation of V&amp;V approaches as they apply to the development of AI &#8220;Trust&#8221; for operational situations. Of particular interest is the use of Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) methods and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) for pre-mission evaluation of learning integrity. Methods that utilize Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) platforms for AI capability implementation will be of particular interest. Methods that utilize multiple laboratory facilities for federated learning are also of special interest.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221;1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)2 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The Mining Innovations for Negative Emissions Resource Recovery (MINER) program&#8217;s aim is to support the development of commercial-ready technologies that give the United States a net-zero or net negative emissions pathway toward increased domestic supplies of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and other critical elements required for the transition to clean energy. The lack of a secure domestic supply of these minerals poses a significant supply chain risk for the United States, especially with regard to batteries, renewable energy generation, and transmission. Meanwhile, the domestic mining industry faces the rapid depletion of high-profit deposits, increased cost of mining and processing, expensive management, and accumulation of tailings, resulting in an overall reduced return of investment by conventional mining methods. Consequently, the Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA&#8211;E) is issuing this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) with objectives to support the development of technology and approaches to: (1) decrease comminution energy by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; (2) increase yield of energy-relevant minerals by reducing unrecovered energy-relevant minerals in the tailings by 50% compared to state-of-the-art; and (3) enabling the negative emissions production of key minerals by sequestering &gt;10 wt.% CO2e per metric ton of ore processed. Four categories have been identified as necessary to achieve these goals and are discussed in detail later: I. Mineral comminution II. Improvements to beneficiation and processing to increase mineral yield III. Carbon negative reactions IV. Sensing, analyzing and enabling carbonation potential and mineralization This FOA supports the development of viable technologies to achieve these goals cost-effectively with the potential to reach commercial scalability. Identified within this FOA are technical categories of interest in Section I.G. Also provided within this FOA are performance targets for the technical categories of interest in Section I.H. Lastly, Sections I.I and I.J of the FOA provide information on technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) requirements, respectively.

The UDN also aims to promote the use of genomics data in disease diagnosis and to share data and approaches widely throughout the scientific community. This highly successful Common Fund program will end in July 2023. To have a broader impact on the clinical practice of undiagnosed diseases in the US, the NIH envisions the UDN evolving into a larger, self-sustained network that, with public and private partners, can provide expert diagnostic services for diverse populations across the nation and foster scientific discovery. To assist in the transition towards sustainability, the NIH intends to fund a Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) to provide coordination, infrastructure, data management, and clinical research support to clinical sites with expertise in diagnosing challenging and difficult-to-diagnose diseases (see related Notice NOT-NS-22-071). A Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to solicit applications for the DMCC is expected to be published in spring of 2022. This Notice informs the research community that NIH intends to publish a program announcement that solicits proposals from highly qualified clinical sites in the US to join the new network through an X01 Resource Access Program award. Successful applicants will demonstrate that they have the appropriate infrastructure, expertise, and resources needed to conduct the clinical evaluation and DNA sequencing of participants enrolled at their sites (described in more detail below). Accepted sites will be designated as a &#8220;Diagnostic Center of Excellence (DCoE)&#8221; and have access to DMCC resources and infrastructure including access to high-quality phenotypic and genotypic data and collaboration with highly skilled physicians, researchers, and bioinformaticians. DCoEs will be invited to submit their most challenging, unsolved cases for acceptance into the network, and partner in their evaluation with the network&#8217;s virtual case review committee(s), which will be coordinated by the DMCC. To qualify as a DCoE, each site will be expected to enroll a minimum of 5 participants per year, although some sites may have the capacity to enroll more participants. Unlike current UDN operations (see: UDN Manual of Operations), a DCoE may choose to specialize in an area of clinical practice (e.g., pediatrics, neurology, cardiovascular, immunologic, environmental insults, etc.). Although DCoEs will not receive direct NIH funds through the X01 mechanism, participating sites will have the opportunity to apply for small amounts of funds each year administered by the DMCC to support site coordination associated with data sharing and small, exploratory research projects needed to facilitate a participant&#8217;s diagnosis (e.g., gene function studies in model organisms and non-routine clinical genomics or metabolomics investigations in the range of $25-50K Direct Costs per project). The maximum period of performance will be 5 years. This program announcement is expected to be published in spring of 2023 with an expected application due date in early summer of 2023. This Notice is being published now, in advance of the program announcement, so that potential applicants have sufficient time to develop meaningful collaborations and responsive projects. Details of the planned program announcement are provided below.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The RADx TDR data will allow better understanding of the impact of COVID-19, support research to better inform and develop policies to address current and future pandemics, and support and promote researchers, including AI/AN researchers The RADx TDR is intended to be an independent, tribally directed research data repository using a sovereignty-based governance structure that will provide responsible data sharing and access to researchers and their collaborators who are generating or interested in working with RADx AI/AN research data. The RADx TDR will collaborate with the RADx-Underserved Populations Coordination and Data Collection Center (RADx-UP CDCC). The TDR will not hold any biological samples. This FOA will use the U24 Resource-Related Research Projects-Cooperative Agreement activity code and seeks to fund a single RADx TDR. The funding for this award is provided from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The RADx TDR will recognize the sovereignty of Tribal Nations by providing overarching tribally based governance, support and guidance in the following two domains: (1) Administrative Operations and Logistics and (2) Data Collection, Integration and Data Sharing. RADx funded projects are required to collect all NIH RADx Required Common Data Elements and share these data at a cadence defined by NIH and Tribal Nation data transfer and use agreements throughout the life of the project. The RADx TDR will receive RADx data directly from RADx AI/AN projects for deposit into the RADx TDR. The RADx TDR will facilitate RADx collaborative research by providing organizational and analytical infrastructure and expertise, supporting data integration and analysis, accessing AI/AN RADx research data, and coordinating across specific AI/AN populations participating in the NIH-supported RADx initiatives that are developing and validating new COVID-19 testing technologies.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The UDN also aims to promote the use of genomics data in disease diagnosis and to share data and approaches widely throughout the scientific community. This highly successful Common Fund program will end in July 2023. To have a broader impact on the clinical practice of undiagnosed diseases in the US, the NIH envisions the UDN evolving into a larger, self-sustained network that, with public and private partners, can provide expert diagnostic services for diverse populations across the nation and foster scientific discovery. This Notice informs the research community that NIH intends to publish a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) that solicits applications for the development of a Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC). The DMCC is intended to provide coordination, infrastructure, data management, and clinical research support for a new network of clinical sites. Sites across the US that provide expert diagnostic services for patients with undiagnosed diseases will be solicited to join a collaborative effort that is coordinated by the DMCC to promote diagnosis and the discovery of new disease-associated genes and genomic variants, immunologic and metabolic abnormalities, as well as environmental insults that are causative in previously undiagnosed patients. In this new model, the network will consist of the DMCC, highly qualified and collaborative clinical sites [designated &#8220;Diagnostic Centers of Excellence (DCoEs)&#8221;], the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP), participants with undiagnosed diseases, patient advocacy groups, the NIH, and other stakeholders including external funding or resource providers. A related Notice (NOT-NS-22-072) describes the application process and requirements for clinical sites to join the future network. This FOA will use a cooperative agreement mechanism to fund one DMCC for 5 years (FY2023-2027) and is expected to be published in May 2022 with an application due date in July 2022. This Notice is being published now, in advance of the FOA, so that potential applicants have sufficient time to develop meaningful collaborations and responsive projects. Details of the planned FOA are provided below.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This FOA is intended to accelerate and strengthen multi-disciplinary cancer disparities research in wide ranging areas. Cancer disparities research includes, but is not limited to basic, translational, behavioral, observational, interventional, environmental and population research studies that address the adverse differences in cancer incidence, prevalence, mortality, survivorship, burden and/or response to treatment in racial/ethnic minorities and/or underserved population groups. Proposed collaborations should focus on achieving research objectives that by necessity rely on diverse and complementary expertise, technical capabilities, and resource sets. Importantly, the supplemental request is required to be within the scope of the parent award and should expand the original aims to include a cancer disparity component and possible inclusion of international comparator cohorts. A trans NCI effort, the concept reissuance of the Collaborative Program is supported by NCIs Division of Cancer Biology (DCB), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) and now, also included Center for Global Health.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To advance the study of plant invasion impacts, researchers will analyze 1) how rarity and traits influence the degree to which native plant species are impacted by invaders; 2) how invasions reshape the distribution of functional traits within communities; and 3) how invasions underlie taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic homogenization over space in both space and time, and ask whether invasions underlie homogenization of taxonomic, functions, and phylogenetic diversity. Working with a recently compiled dataset of trait and phylogenetic information for native and nonnative species from 48,000 plots across the US, researchers will use generalized linear mixed models and other approaches to determine how invasion influences community-weighted mean traits. Species invasions can reshape ecological communities, decreasing the abundance of some species while facilitating the success of others. Understanding which species are impacted by invasion can provide a foundation for anticipating the outcomes of novel species interactions under global change. Disproportionate impacts on rare species reduce biodiversity and increase extinction risk, and impacts on common and dissimilar species are more likely to affect ecosystem function and services. The phylogenetic and functional novelty of a non-native species can influence its establishment and abundance, its impacts on recipient species, and the degree to which it alters trait distributions and in turn ecosystem properties. Meta-analyses of invasive plant impacts have highlighted the need to study impacts along gradients of invader abundance and to incorporate species traits. A recently available data compilation will be used to test how the abundances and functional traits of invaders and residents underlie invasion impacts. Products will at least three publications advancing fundamental science and at least one that will address how to manage ecosystem impacts of plant invasions. Ongoing collaborations with federal and state land managers and planners will be used to inform on-the-ground management. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

We have long invested in science, technology, innovation, and partnership (STIP) to achieve progress across many of USAID&#8217;s goals. Today&#8217;s global development landscape is rapidly evolving. Driven by scientific breakthroughs, disruptive innovation, and rapid advancements in information and communication technologies, coupled with growing contributions by the private sector, these changes offer unprecedented opportunities to leverage the world&#8217;s best thinking to solve critical global challenges. Recognizing the value of a more focused and coordinated approach to harnessing these changes, USAID established the Innovation, Technology, and Research (ITR) Hub in November 2020 as part of the newly envisioned Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI). The ITR Hub serves to support USAID in leveraging innovative, technological, and research tools and approaches across all technical and geographic areas in which USAID works. ITR endeavors to take smart risks to test new ideas and partner within the Agency and with other actors to harness the power of innovative tools and approaches that accelerate development impact. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The uncertainty regarding the cause of this increase and the pressing need for medical and educational services among this growing number of children has created a substantial level of concern among researchers, educators, policy makers, advocacy groups and the general public. The Autism CARES Act of 2019 authorized CDC to continue conducting epidemiological studies of ASD among children and the federal budget includes money for CDC to conduct ASD surveillance and research. Accurate and current data continue to be urgently needed, and CDC and its public health partners continue to provide the best available community-level estimates of ASD prevalence, progress in early ASD detection, along with other critical information regarding the characteristics, co-occurring conditions, and functional level of children with ASD. Previous data have suggested that current ASD identification varies by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. Therefore, data from these subgroups and from diverse communities provide valuable information about whether previously observed disparities in ASD identification continue to persist. These findings can be used to develop policies, measure progress in timely ASD detection and service provision, and inform programs--such as Learn the Signs. Act Early. -- to improve health equity. There has been substantial interest among ASD stakeholders in obtaining more information on the characteristics of ASD among adolescents, including services related to the transition to adulthood. In response, the ADDM Network began monitoring ASD among 16-year-old children that were previously ascertained by ADDM at age 8 in some sites. Data collected by the ADDM Network can provide unique population-based information on transition planning, the planned trajectory (e.g., employment, independent living, education) for the immediate post-high school years, as well as detailed data on the changing situation (diagnostic practices, child characteristics, services available) of persons with ASD as children grow. This will be the 6th funding cycle for ADDM Network activities. During the previous cycle, the ADDM Network underwent several extensive changes and modernization efforts to improve the program&#8217;s timeliness, efficiency, and focus on public health practice. Notably, it resulted in the expanded data collection of early ASD identification among 4-year-olds to all ADDM sites, monitoring 16-year-olds with ASD at some sites, and expanded the types of data sources that can be integrated into the ADDM Network (such as Medicaid and/or early childhood data systems).</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking Program (Transitional Housing Program (CFDA 16.736)) supports programs that provide 6-24 months of transitional housing with support services for victims who are homeless or in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance, as a result of a situation of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking; and for whom emergency shelter services or other crisis intervention services are unavailable or insufficient. The term &quot;homeless&quot; means an individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, and includes an individual who is sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason. An individual who is living in a motel, hotel, trailer park, or campground due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations are also considered homeless. Persons living in emergency or transitional shelter are also examples of homelessness. Abandoned individuals in a hospital or awaiting foster care placement are also considered homeless. An individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, or migratory children (as defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167; 6399) who qualify as homeless under 34 U.S.C. &#167; 12473 because the children are living in circumstances described in this paragraph, are also considered to be homeless. (See 34 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12291(a)(12), 12473(6).) The phrase &quot;in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance&quot; means losing one&#8217;s current housing or otherwise needing housing assistance as a result of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Survivors need not be &quot;homeless&quot; as defined above to be &quot;in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance,&quot; nor do they need to be &quot;fleeing&quot; domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. They do, however, need to be individuals for whom &quot;emergency shelter services or other crisis intervention services are unavailable or insufficient&quot; to be eligible for assistance under the Transitional Housing Program. (See 34 U.S.C. &#167; 12351(a)(2).) For example, a sexual assault survivor whose current housing situation is no longer viable because of circumstances related to the assault - and for whom there are no sexual assault-focused emergency shelter options in the community - is eligible immediately for transitional housing assistance. For additional information about this program and related performance measures, including how awards contribute to the achievement of program goals and objectives, see: OVW grant program information: OVW Grants and Programs Webpage.

University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners, such as Economic Development Districts (EDDs) by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement, and support regional strategies that result in quality job creation[1], high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region&#8217;s innovation clusters.[2] Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, workforce training programs, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems. Although not required, EDA encourages efforts to reach historically underserved populations and areas, communities of color, women, and other groups facing labor market barriers such as persons with disabilities, disconnected youth, individuals in recovery, individuals with past criminal records, including justice-impacted and reentry participants, individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and veterans and military spouses.

Clusters are essentially networks of similar, synergistic, or complementary entities that are engaged in or with a particular industry sector; have active channels for business transactions and communication; share specialized infrastructure, labor markets, and services; and leverage the region&#8217;s unique competitive strengths to stimulate innovation and create jobs.

This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance. The purpose of this RFI is solely to solicit input for ARPA-E consideration to inform the possible formulation of future programs. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit input for a potential future ARPA-E research program focused on technologies to improve the resilience, reliability, and security of the medium voltage (MV) electric power distribution system by undergrounding power lines. The goals of this research effort would be to develop 1) reliable and safe construction and installation technologies for underground MV distribution systems that are cost-competitive to constructing overhead systems, 2) technologies for robust health monitoring and predictive maintenance of existing and new underground power distribution systems, and 3) approaches to enable rapid repair with minimal surface disruptions. ARPA-E is seeking information at this time regarding transformative, scalable, and rapidly deployable technologies that could: (a) Reduce the cost of civil works associated with overhead-to-underground conversion or the construction of new underground power lines close to existing buildings and active surface use (e.g. road traffic) while minimizing surface disruption. (b) Construct underground vaults and install conduits in various terrain types and geologic conditions cost-effectively while avoiding damage to existing underground infrastructure such as subways, gas pipes, potable water and sewer pipes, and telecommunication wires. (c) Dramatically reduce errors in the underground cable installation processes where failures are prone to occur (e.g. cable splices, installation of cables). (d) Improve the performance of installed systems with advanced sensing and data tools (e.g. monitoring and analyzing system health, locating point of failure quickly and precisely, detecting and categorizing incipient failures before they cause a catastrophic failure). (e) Repair a point of failure quickly and safely with minimal surface disruption for prompt power restoration in the event of a failure. ARPA-E is interested in learning about the barriers to implementing underground MV distribution systems and technological innovations required to overcome such barriers. ARPA-E would also like to be informed about the priorities of potential technology development areas in order to create the most impactful potential program to overcome such barriers.

This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is designed to support teams of investigators that seek to cross boundaries of interdisciplinary collaboration to elucidate the contributions of dynamic circuit activity to a specific behavioral or neural system. Applications are encouraged to propose adventurous and challenging goals that can only be tackled by a synergistic team-based approach and have the potential to be transformative and/or to enable significant advances. These studies at the exploratory stage are intended for the development of experimental capabilities and/or theoretical frameworks in preparation for a future competition for larger-scale or extended efforts, including the BRAIN TargetedBCP R01 or the multi-component, Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Programs (U19).The overall goal of this FOA is to enable a large-scale analysis of neural systems and circuits within the context and during the simultaneous measurement of an ethologically relevant behavior. Toward this end, teams are expected to assemble and leverage multi-disciplinary expertise, and to integrate experimental with computational and theoretical approaches. Teams are expected to bridge fields by incorporating rich information on cell-types, on circuit functionality and connectivity, in conjunction with sophisticated analyses of an ethologically relevant behavior of an organism or a well-defined neural system.

PAS Zambia invites organizations interested in potential funding to submit Statements of Interest outlining program concepts that reflect this goal. This is an Annual Program Statement, which is an annual funding opportunity to generate competition for new awards. Please carefully follow all instructions below. The submission of a Statement of Interest (SOI) is the first step in a two-part process. Applicants must first submit an SOI, which is a concise concept note that describes your program idea and its objectives before the development of a full proposal application. Upon review of eligible SOIs, PAS will invite selected applicants to expand their ideas into full proposal applications. SOIs may be submitted for consideration through April 15, 2022. Successful SOI applicants will be notified via email by May 6, 2022. Instructions on the requirements of a full application submission will be provided at that time. Purpose of Small Grants: PAS invites proposals from non-profit and non-governmental organizations for projects that support core U.S. government priorities in Zambia, including promoting democracy and good governance, building inclusive economic prosperity, strengthening health systems, and advancing peace and security. Successful proposals will include a component that relates to the United States. This could be a component that promotes participation in U.S. exchange programs and sharing of experiences during U.S. exchange programs, sharing of models and ideas learned during U.S. exchange programs, promotion of U.S. culture and values, or components that promote a better understanding of the United States. Successful proposals will clearly describe the U.S. component of the program. Successful proposals will clearly define the anticipated results of the program, when results will be expected, and how the U.S. Embassy can measure the anticipated results. Successful grantees will proactively show progress towards results through regular reporting to the U.S. Embassy. U.S. Embassy officials will visit project activities regularly to monitor progress. This grants program generally does not favorably review proposals to hold conferences. Priority Program Areas (in no specific order): Promoting inclusion of people with disabilities and from other underserved or marginalized groups through sports, civic engagement, economic activity, and other aspects of society. Promoting political awareness and participation among the public and/or among youth; Promoting civic education and youth participation in civics, democratic processes, volunteerism, and community service; Promoting democracy and accountability through film or the arts; Fostering press freedom, independent media, professionalism in the media, including through journalism training programs; Combatting corruption; Empowerment of women and youth; Promoting entrepreneurship and business development; Human rights; Promoting sports diplomacy or a shared interest in sports; and Increasing Zambians&#8217; pursuit of higher education in the United States. Participants and Audiences: Programs may be geared to a variety of audiences, depending on the topic. Proposals will be evaluated based on a well-reasoned strategy for the intended audience, as well as appropriate inclusivity, whether based on gender, religion, age, or disability.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>3</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This program is intended to be a national resource for individuals of reproductive age, their partners, and health care providers, with an emphasis on underserved populations. This program will provide resources (including web-based resources), information, and individual risk assessment and counseling to pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, individuals planning to become pregnant, their partners, and providers, in order to ensure informed decision-making to support maternal and fetal/infant health, and ultimately prevent adverse pregnancy and infant health outcomes. The network (&#8220;TIS network&#8221;) of teratogen information service counseling centers (&#8220;TIS centers&#8221;) should be able to respond to inquiries in a variety of formats (e.g., text messages, phone calls, emails) and serve all ten regions identified as such by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and served by HHS regional offices. The TIS network must be able to disseminate objective, current, and easy-to-understand information about the impact of environmental and medical exposures, targeting underserved populations, defined as people living in medically underserved areas, or who share particular characteristics that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social and civic life.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

For many years, however, there have been limited opportunities for foreign arts presenters to come to the United States and see artists at events in geographically diverse areas of our country. Opportunities such as these create new markets for working artists, expand mutual understanding, and raise the profile of each participating U.S. region. The NEA&#8217;s Performing Arts Discovery (PAD) program addresses this ongoing gap through support to the Regional Arts Organizations (RAOs) for activities that showcase U.S.-based performing artists to arts presenters based outside of the United States. PAD has operated virtually since 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program has sustained its efforts as a networking and exchange program, with online activities to ensure U.S. artists continue to have the resources and relationships to connect with global presenters and audiences. The program will continue to be offered virtually. In 2022, the NEA will award one (1) grant of up to $200,000 to an RAO to manage the program nationwide. The NEA&#8217;s period of performance support may begin no earlier than October 1, 2022 and extend for up to 24 months. The award recipient may not receive more than one NEA award for the same project/costs during the same or an overlapping period of performance.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Coordinating Center will develop an inventory of resources and tools to be available on-demand for community organizations, practitioners, and providers addressing this population, as well as support efforts of demonstration sites funded under MP-CPI-22-005 to identify and implement innovative strategies to enhance language access services through: (1) policy development and implementation; (2) technology utilization; (3) education for individuals with LEP; and (4) education for providers, including medical support staff. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: This initiative advances the implementation of high quality and established methods, tools, resources, training, and practices that have been researched and have demonstrated effectiveness in informing individuals of limited English proficiency (LEP) of their rights to language services across the nation. The Coordinating Center will be critical in helping states, tribes, and communities to support effective language access, and therefore improve health-seeking behaviors of LEP populations. Populations with (LEP) experience significant barriers to accessing health care services and understanding health information. They are more likely than populations whose primary language is English to have no source of care, report lower self-rated health, and lack health insurance. Limited literacy is associated with difficulties in proper medication use, utilization of health services and communication with providers. Federal laws and regulations, like Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, require meaningful access for people who are LEP to federally funded programs and activities. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Modified Dates</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The purpose of this program is to advance statewide systems of comprehensive early childhood developmental promotion, screenings, and interventions that improve outcomes and reduce disparities in early developmental health and family well-being for communities with high levels of childhood poverty. These statewide systems will be referred to as early childhood development (ECD) systems throughout this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO). One award will be made, in the form of a cooperative agreement, to establish an Early Childhood Evidence to Impact Center, hereby referred to as the Center. The goals of the Center are to: 1) increase the implementation and evaluation of evidence-informed, equity-focused strategies among states by providing national technical assistance (TA) and supporting the implementation and evaluation of ECD systems-building efforts; and 2) strengthen the evidence base in support of ECD systems-building. In pursuit of these goals, the Center will advance the following objectives: 1. Build, compile, and disseminate the ECD systems evidence base through the development and advancement of a learning agenda.6 2. Advance statewide reach and impact of ECD systems through support of implementation and evaluation of evidence-informed, equity-focused strategies in at least three states with Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) initiatives. 3. Increase the number of early childhood and health system leaders7 in at least 25 states receiving targeted or universal TA, to build capacity to implement and evaluate statewide ECD systems. 4. Improve the adaptability and ease of use of at least 10 resources and/or tools to accelerate ECD systems development. 5. Generate at least one comprehensive model for ECD systems-building for testing and use. This NOFO also describes an opportunity for additional funding, pending availability of funds, to advance the specific strategy of improving delivery of high-quality ECD promotion and support services in pediatric settings. If funded, the recipient will expand activities under the core ECDHS: Evidence to Impact program to provide national leadership, TA, coordination, and evaluation in support of the anticipated Transforming Pediatrics for Early Childhood (TPEC) program (see Appendix D and HRSA-22-141, when published, for details). Through this additional TPEC TA Activity, the Center will: 1. Provide TA and build the capacity of approximately 20 state-level resource hubs that will sustainably integrate ECD experts into pediatric practices that serve a population with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) patients. 2. Accelerate and sustain the spread and impact of ECD integration in pediatric practices through evidence-building, coordination, and field leadership. The TPEC program and associated TA will improve equitable access to a continuum of ECD services and improve the capacity of pediatric practices and workforce to deliver high-quality ECD services that address the holistic needs of children and families. The application&#8217;s overall score will be based on the response to all information requested in this NOFO, including the potential additional TPEC TA Activity; therefore, all applicants are expected to respond to this opportunity for additional funding, as well as the core program elements.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

See the solicitation for the Step-2 due date. Step-2 proposals cannot be submitted if a Step-1 proposal was not submitted. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs.

However, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency has posed significant challenges for RWHAP recipients, providers, and clients to provide and access care. On February 23, 2021, HRSA HAB released a letter that waived certain statutory penalties and administrative requirements for funds awarded in FY 2020 and 2021 in accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116- 260, Division M, &#167; 307. Requirements regarding the timeframe for obligation and expenditure of formula and supplemental RWHAP funds within the designated timeframe, including the requirement to submit an estimated unobligated balance and carryover request prior to the end of the grant year, and associated penalties were waived. Therefore, no states/territories will be deemed ineligible for the FY 2022 RWHAP States/Territories Part B Supplemental Grant Program. Failure to expend at least 95 percent of RWHAP Part B/ADAP formula funds in FY 2022 or future years will result in penalties.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>Agency Code:</td><td>HHS-HRSA</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>Agency Name:</td><td>Department of Health and Human Services<br>Health Resources and Services Administration</td></tr><tr><td>Posted Date:</td><td>Feb 28, 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Close Date:</td><td>May 09, 2022 </td></tr><tr><td>Last Updated Date:</td><td>Feb 28, 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Award Ceiling:</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Award Floor:</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated Total Program Funding:</td><td>$52,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Expected Number of Awards:</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Description:</td><td>This notice announces the opportunity to apply for funding under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) States/Territories Part B Supplemental Grant Program, which includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The purpose of this program is to supplement formula-based funding provided through the HIV Care Grant Program &#8211; RWHAP Part B States/Territories Formula and AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Formula and ADAP Supplemental Awards Notice of Funding Opportunity (HRSA-22-033). States/territories use RWHAP Part B Supplemental Grant Program funding in conjunction with RWHAP Part B HIV Care Grant Program funding to develop and/or enhance access to a comprehensive continuum of high-quality care and treatment services for low-income people with HIV. To obtain funding, states/territories must demonstrate that RWHAP Part B supplemental funding is necessary to provide comprehensive HIV care and treatment services for people with HIV in the state/territory. Proposed activities should include the provision of core medical and/or support services, as defined in HRSA HAB Policy Clarification Notice (PCN) 16-02: RWHAP Services: Eligible Individuals and Allowable Uses of Funds, and other activities to ensure responsiveness to unmet needs. States/territories must describe how proposed activities will address unmet needs and improve client-level health outcomes across the HIV care continuum, including viral suppression. Eligible RWHAP Part B states/territories that are focus areas, or have counties that are focus areas, for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative should consider if there is an increased need for RWHAP Part B supplemental funding due to the EHE initiative efforts using criteria below. As required in section 2620(b) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, states/territories must demonstrate the severity of the need for RWHAP Part B supplemental funding using quantifiable data in one or more of the following areas: 1. The unmet need for such services, as determined under section 2617(b) of the PHS Act. 2. An increasing need for HIV/AIDS-related services, including relative rates of increase in the number of cases of HIV/AIDS. 3. The relative rates of increase in the number of cases of HIV/AIDS within new or emerging subpopulations. 4. The current prevalence of HIV/AIDS. 5. Relevant factors related to the cost and complexity of delivering health care to individuals with HIV/AIDS in the eligible area. 6. The impact of co-morbid factors, including co-occurring conditions, determined relevant by the Secretary. 7. The prevalence of homelessness. 8. The prevalence of individuals who were released from federal, state, or local prisons during the preceding three (3) years, and had HIV/AIDS on the date of their release. 9. The relevant factors that limit access to health care, including geographic variation, adequacy of health insurance coverage, and language barriers. 10. The impact of a decline in the amount of RWHAP Part B funding received on services available to all individuals with HIV/AIDS identified and eligible under this title. Pursuant to section 2620(c) of the PHS Act, the Secretary prioritizes funds to states/territories to address the reduction or disruption of services related to a decline in the amount of formula funding. Such a decline in funding is determined by comparing the amount of formula funding received in the current fiscal year (FY) to the amount received in FY 2006. If you are a state/territory with current or potential shortfalls in ADAP resources, HRSA strongly encourages you to prioritize use of RWHAP Part B supplemental funds to augment ADAP resources when the following conditions exist: 1. Existing or anticipated ADAP waiting list, 2. Capped enrollment, 3. Reductions in ADAP formulary, 4. Reduction in the percentage of federal poverty level (FPL) eligibility requirement, and/or 5. Other ADAP restrictions within the state/territory.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

It is a leading cause of death and nonfatal injuries in the United States and constitutes a major public health crisis, especially among young people, and in particular among racial/ethnic minority, sexual and gender minority (SGM) and disability populations. Firearm homicide is the third leading cause of death among persons aged 10 to 24 years and the leading cause of death among Black men (45 years of age). NIH is committed to supporting research that identifies innovative prevention approaches to reduce firearm and related violence, injury and mortality. Within the legislative mandates and limitations of NIH funding (NOT-OD-21-058, NOT-OD-21-056), this initiative will support a network of research projects to develop and test interventions at the community or community organization level that aim to prevent firearm and related violence, injury and mortality.This FOA solicits bi-phasic research projects proposed in UG3/UH3 Phased Innovation Awards Cooperative Agreement applications. Funding for the UG3 phase (phase I) will be used to demonstrate sufficient preparation, feasibility and capacity to meet foundational milestone targets specific to the work proposed. A UG3 project that meets its milestones will be administratively considered by NIH and prioritized for transition to the UH3 award phase II). Applicants responding to this FOA must address specific aims and milestones for both the UG3 and UH3 phases.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Demonstration Sites will work collaboratively with the coordinating center (funded under MP-CPI-22-004) and are expected to implement innovative strategies to enhance language access services through: (1) policy development and implementation; (2) technology utilization; (3) education for individuals with LEP; (4) education for providers, including medical support staff; and (5) partnerships with nonprofit community-based organizations to support language access for LEP populations. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: This initiative advances the implementation of policies, tools, resources, training, and practices that have been researched and have demonstrated effectiveness in informing individuals of limited English proficiency (LEP) of their rights to language services across the nation. Populations with (LEP) experience significant barriers to accessing health care services and understanding health information. They are more likely than populations whose primary language is English to have no source of care, report lower self-rated health, and lack health insurance. Limited literacy is associated with difficulties in proper medication use, utilization of health services and communication with providers. Federal laws and regulations, like Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, require meaningful access for people who are LEP to federally-funded programs and activities. This initiative advances the implementation of high-quality established methods, tools, resources, training, and practices that have been researched and have demonstrated effectiveness in informing individuals of limited English proficiency (LEP) of their rights to language services across the nation. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Modified due, post and award dates</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This NOFO aims to support the following three categories of strategies to help build the laboratory-preparedness competency of clinical laboratory professionals: Bridge - strengthen essential links between clinical and public health laboratory training professionals and CDC; Train - develop and evaluate education and training resources for clinical laboratory professionals to be ready, respond, and lead others; and Sustain - expand the reach of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC&apos;s) training and workforce development resources among the clinical laboratory community, including those who perform point-of-care testing, and promote awareness of the laboratory profession to broader audiences. This NOFO will be implemented through a cooperative agreement (CoAg). The three strategies will be implemented using a data-driven approach to enhance the clinical laboratory community&apos;s ability to combat emerging threats, learn evolving practices, and stay current with the newest standards and technologies. The goals of the NOFO are in accordance with the Healthy People 2030 goals. The overall CDC Evaluation and Performance Measurement Strategy will focus on both process and outcome evaluation. Strategies and activities that will lead to intended outcomes will be outlined in the Logic Model. Post-award, CDC will work with each recipient to develop and finalize a detailed Evaluation and Performance Management Plan (EPMP) which includes a Data Management Plan (DMP), in accordance with CDC program guidance. Monitoring activities will include but are not limited to discussions on work plans, progress reports, performance measures, financial data, conference calls and site visits. Data collection requirements during the project period will be subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

By 2050 there will be no ethnic majority in the United States (U.S.). There is a need to ensure that the disability community keeps pace with and is responsive to the rapidly changing demographics of the country and the UCEDDs should play a critical role in such an effort. The DD Act of 2000 recognizes the important role that UCEDDs play in enhancing the diversity of the workforce, requiring that UCEDDs enhance efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented groups at all levels in order to respond to the needs of nation and burgeoning diverse communities. It is essential now more than ever to ensure that UCEDDs are well positioned to address the unprecedented growth of diverse communities, including the growth in the number of people with disabilities, to ensure the future yields prosperity for all. To this end, UCEDDs need to know how to align their training programs and overall UCEDD organizational framework to truly reflect and respond to our nation&apos;s rich diversity.The Administration on Disabilities (AOD), Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the availability of Fiscal Year 2022 funds to award, on a competitive basis, three year National Training Initiative (NTI) grants to multiple University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service (UCEDDs). AoD plans to award up to eight Partnership Planning grants to pay for the federal share of this initiative. Funds will be used to support the development of a partnership training program. These partnership planning grants will be with Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI)s as defined in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008; community colleges, and training programs that serve people from underrepresented communities.This funding opportunity will provide seed funding to support partnership planning grants with partner organizations defined as a MSI, community college, or other training program that serve underrepresented populations to jointly plan and co-design training experiences and utilize a variety of innovative knowledge exchange and transfer strategies that promote and create interdisciplinary approaches to research, training (e.g., pre-service, continuing education, community-based), and services.Funds will be used to work towards the long term goals of: Increasing diversity of leadership, staff and governing bodies across the DD network; Building cultural competence capacity with the leadership, staff, and governing bodies across the DD network; Increasing the number of persons from underrepresented racial, ethnic groups, people with disabilities, people from disadvantaged backgrounds who benefit from AoD supported programs; and Improving the recruitment and employment of underrepresented groups including racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and people from diverse or disadvantaged backgrounds in the UCEDD.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Under this new Funding Opportunity, grant funds will be awarded for projects that deploy technology to modernize and enhance battlefield interpretation and education at Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War battlefield sites eligible for assistance under the battlefield acquisition grant program established under 54 U.S.C. &#167;308103(b). Grants require a non-Federal cost share of at least 50%. State, local, and tribal governments and nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply. Successful projects should: include expertise in content, interpretive and educational methods, and integration of technology at all stages of the project; convene a project team with a diversity of perspectives and sources of knowledge (disciplinary, cultural, experiential, etc.) &#8211; to better understand and interpret the past, projects should not rely on a single subject matter expert; incorporate recent and high-quality scholarship on the historical, social, and/or natural contexts of battlefields and associated sites; undergo clear, collaborative, and comprehensive scoping with both subject matter specialists and technical specialists prior to technical production; use technology in ways that foster effective communication with the intended audience(s) - projects may combine multiple forms of technology or traditional interpretive media, and grants may fund stakeholder consultation and audience research to ensure that appropriate platforms and technologies are selected; ensure accessibility for people with disabilities (e.g. through subtitles and audio description of videos, or wheelchair-accessible exhibit areas), following Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, as applicable (see https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm); define appropriate metrics and strategies for evaluating the project&#8217;s effectiveness during and after implementation; and plan for technological and institutional sustainability. To encourage a collaborative approach to project development and efficient use of Federal funds, two categories of grants are available for projects in different stages: Scoping grants are available to fund early stages of project development, such as research and content creation, consultation with stakeholders, exploration of available technologies, audience research, and development of technical proposals. The federal share for these grants should range from $20,000-$50,000 and have a period of performance of 1-2 years. Implementation grants are available to applicants who have completed interdisciplinary scoping prior to application and can provide draft content and design plans. The federal share for these grants should range from $50,000-$200,000 and have a period of performance of 2-3 years. It is not necessary to receive a scoping grant before applying for an implementation grant, but the application must show that equivalent preparatory work has been completed. On a case-by-case basis, amounts and periods of performance may differ from the above recommendations. Applicants may contact the NPS American Battlefield Protection Program with questions about developing an application. As the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, NPS ABPP encourages projects that promote and expand preservation as well as enhance our understanding of the origins of the United States. Special thematic priority will be given to applications that preserve and interpret historic sites associated with the American Revolutionary War as a living part of community life and development. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The purpose of the activity is to increase adoption and maintenance of malaria prevention and treatment behaviors in target areas of Mozambique through the use of evidence-based and theory-driven social and behavior change (SBC) activities. This will be achieved through the following objective: Increased and improved malaria social and behavioral change (SBC) design, implementation, and monitoring by Ministry of Health and implementation partners. These objectives will be achieved in coordination and collaboration with key partners and stakeholders, including the Government of Mozambique, other donors, implementing partners, and non-governmental organizations, and will contribute to the Ministry of Health&apos;s 2017-2022 National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) objective of implementing an effective SBC approach to ensure that people seek appropriate and timely healthcare and use an appropriate protection method. Accomplishment of these objectives will also depend on a close working relationship between this activity and other USAID activities targeting malaria control and elimination. Given the geographic scope of USAID&#8217;s malaria programming in Mozambique, activities in these areas will be implemented at the provincial, district, and community levels in provinces of Nampula, Zambezia, and Manica, in addition to providing support at the central level. This activity will also support media interventions in Cabo Delgado. USAID&#8217;s contributions in each province will be coordinated with other USAID-funded initiatives. Nampula and Zamb&#233;zia continue as key provinces for USAID&#8217;s goal of reducing malaria in high transmission areas. The province of Manica is a new priority province for USAID due to its high malaria prevalence and incidence. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Eligible U.S. citizens must possess at least a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and ideally will have agricultural experience, including teaching agricultural skills, and curriculum and/or program development. FAS will consider program proposals from all eligible organizations, including current recipients and new organizations.The IAEFP&#8217;s purpose is to connect American agricultural professionals to the demand for experiential, school-based agricultural education in developing countries. The IAEFP was first implemented in Ghana and Uganda during calendar year 2021-2022. The IAEFP, affords United States agriculturalists to develop a global mindset, collaboratively meet the food and fiber needs of the domestic population of eligible countries, and strengthen and enhance trade linkages between eligible countries and the United States agricultural industry.OBJECTIVESIAEFP emphasizes agricultural skill transfer to youth in priority country secondary schools and encourages community-based extension and teacher training, as well as development of 4H clubs for strong sustainability of the program. Proposal submission should include, but is not limited to, classroom instruction, field demonstrations, entrepreneurship projects, and leadership development. The proposal should address priority country&#8217;s receptiveness of the IAEFP and what, if any, country policies and procedures will be necessary to incorporate into the project work plan for strong program implementation and sustainability. Host country&#8217;s government, agriculture community, and local authorities should demonstrate support and commitment to collaborate on the implementation and execution of the IAEFP.PRIORITIESThe recipient should provide a suggested curriculum to all Fellows that is tailored to the needs of the priority country. Fellow&#8217;s training topics should align with USDA and the priority country&#8217;s agricultural policy, development, and extension goals. FAS expects that proposals will build upon past IAEFP activities and what has been accomplished to date. The recipient may also draw on additional resources and best practices from similar programs for robust program development. Topics should also promote bilateral agricultural trade between the priority country and the United States and should address priorities on Climate Smart Agricultural practices. For additional recipient requirements, please see the Performance Expectations in Section F. Applicants must submit a draft evaluation plan as an attachment. Each evaluation plan shouldinclude a comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluating the project&#8217;s performance and impact. This includes specific performance goals, an activity-level results framework, performance indicators with targets for each program activity, and plans for baseline and program-related data collection.USDA anticipates issuing one award. The award is expected to support up to nine (9) fellows. The fellowship is expected to last 8-9 months in concurrence with the priority country&#8217;s academic year. United States fellows participating under IAEFP must hold a minimum of a bachelor&#8217;s degree in an agriculture-related field and understand U.S. school-based agricultural education and youth extension programs. After selection, recipients will be expected to identify fellows through an organized recruitment process including a request for applications, and accompanying candidate selection process. In addition, the National FFA Organization (FFA) and the National 4-H Council (4-H) must be consulted on U.S. fellow selections. Applicants are expected to identify their respective 4-H and FFA selection SME panel representatives within thirty days following negotiations. All final fellow selections must be submitted to the USDA for final concurrence.Although each fellow should be assigned to a specific site within the proposed country, they are expected to participate as a cohesive cohort. All proposal submissions must demonstrate that security considerations have been assessed and address all measures that would be implemented to ensure the safety and security of participating U.S. fellows. Additionally, fellows should be provided with adequate and safe living accommodations. Examples of safe living accommodations include but are not limited to schools&#8217; dorms with a security guard, host family accommodations, private transportation arrangements, etc. Living arrangements ought to be considered in liaison with the priority country&#8217;s U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer recommendations. Applicants should also include in their orientation a safety and security self-defense training. Award recipients will be required to work with USDA/FAS IAEFP Team, and, if necessary, relevant FAS overseas offices and/or appropriate U.S. Embassy personnel on all programmatic issues, including but not limited to target country partnerships, fellow placements, and security measures. Additionally, a strong social media presence displaying the ongoing activities of the IAEFP is encouraged. Finally, regular updates on program implementation should also be provided to USDA/FAS Washington, D.C. and FAS overseas office representatives.PLACE OF PERFORMANCE For this solicitation, IAEFP will focus on the Northern Triangle region of Central America, particularly the countries of Guatemala and El Salvador. Applicants may submit multiple applications for different countries within the Northern Triangle; and all will be considered. Applicants may submit applications for countries outside of the Northern Triangle although applications for the Northern Triangle region will be prioritized. All proposals must address the safety and security situation in proposed country(ies) and the regions within the country(ies) where Fellows will be placed. All proposals must address where the IAEFP can work in conjunction with the Norman E. Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program, the Cochran Fellowship Program, the Food for Progress Program, the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, the Local and Regional Procurement Program, Peace Corps, and/or USAID or other USG programming. All proposals should recognize and demonstrate incorporation of any priority country government requirements to allow for smooth implementation of this program. Program implementation must be focused on program sustainability and collaboration with the host government to help build/enhance the country&#8217;s agricultural education curriculum.Issuance of this funding opportunity does not constitute an award or commitment on the part of the United States Government (USG) to make awards, nor does it commit the USG to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a concept note or full application.Each proposal must be country-specific and tailored to the context of that country. Depending on ever-changing on the ground security situations, the USDA selecting official may elect not to award or fund proposals for a country(ies). In addition, USDA may elect to make amendments to agreements. The USDA selecting official may also select applications out of rank order in consideration of strategic program priorities, such as geographical distribution, incorporation of minority-serving institutions, congressional directive, or other documented considerations. These determinations are final and cannot be appealed.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Enactment of additional continuing resolutions or an appropriations act may affect the availability or level of funding for this program. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is announcing the potential availability of funding for agreements for the purpose of leveraging NRCS resources, addressing local natural resource issues, encouraging collaboration and developing state-and-community-level conservation leadership. Proposals must be for projects based in Texas and focus on conservation priority topics as noted in Section A of this notice. Collaborative projects that provide on-the-ground support for Texas NRCS Field Offices are highly encouraged. Research proposals will not be accepted, nor considered. For new users of Grants.gov, see Section D. for information about steps required before submitting an application via Grants.gov. Key Dates Applicants must submit their applications via Grants.gov by 11:59 pm Eastern Time on May 6, 2022. For technical issues with Grants.gov, contact Grants.gov Applicant Support at 1-800-518-4726 or support@grants.gov. Awarding agency staff cannot support applicants regarding Grants.gov accounts. For inquiries specific to the content of the NFO requirements, contact the federal awarding agency contact (section G of this NFO). Please limit questions to those regarding specific information contained in this NFO (such as dates, page numbers, clarification of discrepancies, etc.) Questions related to eligibility, or the merits of a specific proposal will not be addressed. A webinar will be held for potential applicants (information pertaining to date, time, how to connect, etc. will be posted on the Texas NRCS website under Texas Partners for Conservation , when known.) The agency anticipates making selections by June 2022 and expects to execute awards by September 2022. These dates are estimates and are subject to change. Federal Funding Floor and Ceiling Amounts The estimated funding floor for this opportunity is $30,000, and the estimated funding ceiling is $150,000. The funding floor means the minimum agreement funding amount for the Federal share per agreement awarded. The ceiling is the maximum agreement funding amount for the Federal share per agreement awarded. These numbers refer to the total agreement amount, not any specific budget period. Federal Financial Assistance Training The funding available through this NFO is Federal financial assistance. Grants 101 Training is highly recommended for those seeking knowledge about Federal financial assistance. The training is free and available to the public via https://www.cfo.gov/grants-training/. It consists of five modules covering each of the following topics: 1) laws, regulations, and guidance; 2) financial assistance mechanisms; 3) uniform guidance administrative requirements; 4) cost principles; and 5) risk management and single audit. FPAC agencies also apply Federal financial assistance regulations to certain non-assistance awards (e.g., non-assistance cooperative agreements).</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Proposals must demonstrate how the proposed restoration will improve conditions and achieve habitat restoration for waterfowl and/or native fish and wildlife species, and other aquatic species throughout the Klamath Basin. The headwaters of the Klamath River start in Oregon in the arid mountains east of the Cascade Range in southern Oregon. Downstream of the headwaters, these waters support one of the largest lake-wetlands complexes in the western U.S. The Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex (which comprise six National Wildlife Refuges in total) has been referred to as the &#8220;Everglades of the West&#8221; because of its biological diversity and importance to the Pacific Flyway as a staging area for millions of waterbirds on their spring and fall migrations. Downstream of Upper Klamath Lake, the Klamath River flows through steep forested mountains of Northern California where it eventually meets the sea near the town of Klamath, CA. The Klamath River once supported the third most productive salmon run on the West Coast of the United States. Today, Klamath Basin fisheries are in decline including spring-run and fall-run Chinook salmon, and there are several species of fish on the Endangered Species list such as Lost River and shortnose suckers, bull trout, and coho salmon and other Tribal trust species. This funding opportunity is intended for projects and activities that support or will help improve river, riparian, lake, and wetland habitats, which historically supported millions of fish, waterfowl, and other native wildlife. The Service invites project proposals that fall within the entire Klamath Basin drainage from the headwaters to the mouth of the Klamath River. Klamath Basin stakeholders have a long history of working together on restoration activities, and have also undertaken the enormous challenge of resolving major natural resource conflicts in the Klamath Basin. Applicants are, therefore, encouraged to submit project proposals that seek out and/or build upon opportunities for collaboration with other conservation partners in the Klamath Basin. As such, the Service is encouraging project proposals to include letters of support from project partners, stakeholders, and other contributors describing their support and any role they may have in assisting with the project. Endorsement letters will help the Service judge whether projects are widely supported. The Service encourages project proposals to include letters of support from local Tribes, Counties and other local governments, States or State Agencies, and other conservation partners. Special consideration will also be given to restoration projects proposed on tribal lands or those that may affect tribes and/or their lands. DOI is committed to equity and environmental justice in program delivery and explicitly seeks to ensure that all projects provide direct, meaningful benefits consistent with Justice40 and other related initiatives. Applications will be considered accordingly.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Eligible U.S. citizens must possess at least a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and ideally will have agricultural experience, including teaching agricultural skills, and curriculum and/or program development. FAS will consider program proposals from all eligible organizations, including current recipients and new organizations.The IAEFP&#8217;s purpose is to connect American agricultural professionals to the demand for experiential, school-based agricultural education in developing countries. The IAEFP was first implemented in Ghana and Uganda during calendar year 2021-2022. The IAEFP, affords United States agriculturalists to develop a global mindset, collaboratively meet the food and fiber needs of the domestic population of eligible countries, and strengthen and enhance trade linkages between eligible countries and the United States agricultural industry.OBJECTIVESIAEFP emphasizes agricultural skill transfer to youth in priority country secondary schools and encourages community-based extension and teacher training, as well as development of 4H clubs for strong sustainability of the program. Proposal submission should include, but is not limited to, classroom instruction, field demonstrations, entrepreneurship projects, and leadership development. The proposal should address priority country&#8217;s receptiveness of the IAEFP and what, if any, country policies and procedures will be necessary to incorporate into the project work plan for strong program implementation and sustainability. Host country&#8217;s government, agriculture community, and local authorities should demonstrate support and commitment to collaborate on the implementation and execution of the IAEFP.PRIORITIESThe recipient should provide a suggested curriculum to all Fellows that is tailored to the needs of the priority country. Fellow&#8217;s training topics should align with USDA and the priority country&#8217;s agricultural policy, development, and extension goals. FAS expects that proposals will build upon past IAEFP activities and what has been accomplished to date. The recipient may also draw on additional resources and best practices from similar programs for robust program development. Topics should also promote bilateral agricultural trade between the priority country and the United States and should address priorities on Climate Smart Agricultural practices. For additional recipient requirements, please see the Performance Expectations in Section F. Applicants must submit a draft evaluation plan as an attachment. Each evaluation plan shouldinclude a comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluating the project&#8217;s performance and impact. This includes specific performance goals, an activity-level results framework, performance indicators with targets for each program activity, and plans for baseline and program-related data collection.USDA anticipates issuing one award. The award is expected to support up to nine (9) fellows. The fellowship is expected to last 8-9 months in concurrence with the priority country&#8217;s academic year. United States fellows participating under IAEFP must hold a minimum of a bachelor&#8217;s degree in an agriculture-related field and understand U.S. school-based agricultural education and youth extension programs. After selection, recipients will be expected to identify fellows through an organized recruitment process including a request for applications, and accompanying candidate selection process. In addition, the National FFA Organization (FFA) and the National 4-H Council (4-H) must be consulted on U.S. fellow selections. Applicants are expected to identify their respective 4-H and FFA selection SME panel representatives within thirty days following negotiations. All final fellow selections must be submitted to the USDA for final concurrence.Although each fellow should be assigned to a specific site within the proposed country, they are expected to participate as a cohesive cohort. All proposal submissions must demonstrate that security considerations have been assessed and address all measures that would be implemented to ensure the safety and security of participating U.S. fellows. Additionally, fellows should be provided with adequate and safe living accommodations. Examples of safe living accommodations include but are not limited to schools&#8217; dorms with a security guard, host family accommodations, private transportation arrangements, etc. Living arrangements ought to be considered in liaison with the priority country&#8217;s U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer recommendations. Applicants should also include in their orientation a safety and security self-defense training. Award recipients will be required to work with USDA/FAS IAEFP Team, and, if necessary, relevant FAS overseas offices and/or appropriate U.S. Embassy personnel on all programmatic issues, including but not limited to target country partnerships, fellow placements, and security measures. Additionally, a strong social media presence displaying the ongoing activities of the IAEFP is encouraged. Finally, regular updates on program implementation should also be provided to USDA/FAS Washington, D.C. and FAS overseas office representatives.PLACE OF PERFORMANCE For this solicitation, IAEFP will focus on the Northern Triangle region of Central America, particularly the countries of Guatemala and El Salvador. Applicants may submit multiple applications for different countries within the Northern Triangle; and all will be considered. Applicants may submit applications for countries outside of the Northern Triangle although applications for the Northern Triangle region will be prioritized. All proposals must address the safety and security situation in proposed country(ies) and the regions within the country(ies) where Fellows will be placed. All proposals must address where the IAEFP can work in conjunction with the Norman E. Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program, the Cochran Fellowship Program, the Food for Progress Program, the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program, the Local and Regional Procurement Program, Peace Corps, and/or USAID or other USG programming. All proposals should recognize anddemonstrate incorporation of any priority country government requirements to allow for smooth implementation of this program. Program implementation must be focused on program sustainability and collaboration with the host government to help build/enhance the country&#8217;s agricultural education curriculum.Issuance of this funding opportunity does not constitute an award or commitment on the part of the United States Government (USG) to make awards, nor does it commit the USG to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a concept note or full application.Each proposal must be country-specific and tailored to the context of that country. Depending on ever-changing on the ground security situations, the USDA selecting official may elect not to award or fund proposals for a country(ies). In addition, USDA may elect to make amendments to agreements. The USDA selecting official may also select applications out of rank order in consideration of strategic program priorities, such as geographical distribution, incorporation of minority-serving institutions, congressional directive, or other documented considerations. These determinations are final and cannot be appealed.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance (see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1)). The date shown of 3/29/2023 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-22 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-23 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-22 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Photoreceptors often called rods and cones are cells in the retina that, when stimulated by light, generate signals the brain perceives as images. The retinal ganglion cells carry these signals from the photoreceptors to the brain. Although there has been some success in regenerating retinal neurons and connections in fish, mice, and other systems, the ultimate goal of the AGI is to restore vision in humans.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To advance Executive Order 13929 Safe Policing for Safe Communities, the Attorney General determined that all state, local, and university or college law enforcement agencies must be certified by an approved independent credentialing body or have started the certification process, to be eligible for FY 2022 DOJ discretionary grant funding. To become certified, the law enforcement agency must meet two mandatory conditions: (1) the agency&amp;rsquo;s use-of-force policies adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and (2) the agency&amp;rsquo;s use-of-force policies prohibit chokeholds except in situations where use of deadly force is allowed by law. The certification requirement also applies to law enforcement agencies receiving DOJ discretionary grant funding through a subaward. For detailed information on this certification requirement, please visit https://cops.usdoj.gov/SafePolicingEO to access the Standards for Certification on Safe Policing for Safe Communities, the Implementation Fact Sheet, and the List of Designated Independent Credentialing Bodies. Foreign governments, foreign organizations, and foreign colleges and universities are not eligible to apply. Federal agencies are eligible to apply.

With this solicitation, NIJ seeks proposals for rigorous research and evaluation projects that inform efforts to prevent and combat hate crimes and their effects. Though applications may cover a range of topics, NIJ is particularly interested in funding research to: (1) understand and prevent hate crime offending and reoffending, (2) identify strategies that improve the reporting, investigating, and prosecuting of hate crimes, (3) address the needs of victims of hate crimes and their communities. Applications proposing research involving partnerships with criminal justice or other agencies, should include a strong letter of support, signed by an appropriate decision-making authority from each proposed, partnering agency. A letter of support should include the partnering agency&#8217;s acknowledgement that de-identified data derived from, provided to, or obtained through this project will be archived by the grant recipient with the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) at the conclusion of the award. Applicants and their potential partners are encouraged to review the NACJD&#8217;s policies and protections at (NACJD). If selected for award, grantees will be expected to have a formal agreement in place with partnering agencies by January 1, 2023. That formal agreement must include a provision to meet the data archiving requirements of the award. In the case of partnerships that will involve the use of federal award funds by multiple partnering agencies to carry out the proposed project, only one entity/partnering agency may be the applicant (as is the case with any application submitted in response to this solicitation); any others must be proposed as subrecipients.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

OJP&#8217;s BJA administers SCAAP. Under SCAAP, OJP is statutorily required to make payments to &quot;states&quot; and &quot;units of local government&quot; that incur certain types of costs due to the &quot;incarceration&quot; of &quot;undocumented criminal aliens&quot; during a specific 12-month &quot;reporting period.&quot; Under the FY 2021 program, payments will be made in connection with &quot;undocumented criminal aliens&quot; who had been convicted of at least one felony or two misdemeanors (typically for violations of state or local law) and who were &quot;incarcerated&quot; under the legal authority of the applicant government for at least 4 consecutive days during the &quot;reporting period.&quot; (Additional details are set out in later sections of this document.) As part of its application, each applicant government provides particular information about individuals it &quot;incarcerated&quot; &#8212; under its own legal authority &#8212; for at least 4 consecutive days during the &quot;reporting period&quot; and whom the applicant government either (1) knows were &quot;undocumented criminal aliens&quot; or (2) reasonably and in good faith believes were &quot;undocumented criminal aliens.&quot; (OJP transmits the data submitted on such individuals to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a detailed review.) As part of its application, each applicant government also must provide information pertinent to its average costs of incarceration during the &quot;reporting period.&quot; Broadly speaking, SCAAP payments are calculated from information provided by applicant governments in online applications, information provided to OJP by DHS regarding the DHS review of data on &quot;eligible inmates,&quot; and the amount of appropriated funds available for the SCAAP application cycle (e.g., for the FY 2021 program). All information submitted as part of an application is subject to appropriate review by OJP.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The U.S. Embassy operates three American Spaces in Zambia: &#183; The American Center at the U.S. Embassy in Lusaka, &#183; The American Corner at National Institute of Public Administration in Lusaka, &#183; And The American Corner at Copperbelt University in Kitwe. Programs funded through this small grants opportunity should be conducted primarily at one of our three American Spaces and leverage the resources and audiences of those Spaces. American Spaces promote critical thinking and thoughtful discussion of issues important to the U.S. relationship with Zambia and U.S. global interests. They do this in keeping with the U.S. commitment to a core tenet of democracy: upholding a citizen&#8217;s right to free access to information. American Spaces counteract negative perceptions and disinformation about the United States, and they offer opportunities to build bridges of mutual respect and understanding between the host country and the people of the United States. All programs must include a strong, central American element, or connection with American expert(s), organization(s), or institution(s) (separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Embassy or its American Corners) and have as a primary goal the promotion of increased understanding of American values, perspectives, and policies and relationship building between Americans and Zambians. Note: Proposed programs may take place virtually or in-person with public health protocols in place, or a combination of both. American Spaces is currently seeking proposals in the following priority areas: &#183; Science and technology, including programs that incorporate 3D printing, robotics, coding, graphic design, engineering, and scientific discovery. Preference is given to an organization that can coordinate ongoing Makerspace programming at our American Corners (NIPA and CBU) over the course of the grant period; &#183; Promoting democracy and political participation among the public and/or youth, including leadership development, civic education, and the promotion of human rights; &#183; Promoting entrepreneurship and small business development; &#183; Support continuing engagement with U.S. government exchange program alumni and connecting them to local audiences through alumni programs in which credible, local voices can share firsthand information about the United States and American values.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Proposals may be submitted at any time, pending certain eligibility timing issues related to resubmissions and duplicate proposal avoidance (see the program element text and appropriate overview appendix (e.g., B.1 or C.1)). The date shown of 3/29/2023 is the last day that proposals may be submitted subject to the ROSES-22 rules and the current Guidebook for Proposers. The ROSES-23 version of this program element is planned to overlap with this ROSES-22 version by a few weeks, allowing continuous submission of proposals across ROSES years. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2022 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2022. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2022 solicitation, and the &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot; as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH22ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2022 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2022, and (3) The ROSES-2022 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) refers to the formal and informal processes and value systems by which people become engineers. It also includes the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers to sustain and grow the profession in order to improve quality of life for all peoples. The engineering profession must be responsive to national priorities, grand challenges, and dynamic workforce needs; it must be equally open and accessible to all. Professional Formation of Engineers includes, but is not limited, to: Introductions to the profession at any age; Development of deep technical and professional skills, knowledge, and abilities in both formal and informal settings/domains; Development of outlooks, perspectives, ways of thinking, knowing, and doing; Development of identity as an engineer and its intersection with other identities; and Acculturation to the profession, its standards, and norms. The goal of the Research in the Formation of Engineers (RFE) program is to advance our understanding of professional formation. It seeks both to deepen our fundamental understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms that support professional formation and to demonstrate how professional formation is or can be accomplished. Ultimately RFE aims to transform the engineer-formation system, and thus the impact of proposed projects on this system must be described. Principal Investigators (PIs) should provide a roadmap detailing how they envision the proposed research will eventually broadly impact practice within the engineer-formation system, even if these activities are not within the scope of the submitted proposal. In order to accomplish its goals, RFE welcomes proposals in two categories: Research Projects, and Design and Development Projects. Research Projects address fundamental questions of professional formation, while Design and Development Projects provide new approaches to achieving professional formation. Additional details are provided below. Projects in both categories should address the iterative cycle in which research questions that advance understanding are informed by practice and the results of research are, in turn, translated into practice. In other words, proposals should explain how the research results will travel, translate, transfer, or scale. Successful projects identify specific target audiences, effective communication channels, and novel partnerships to ensure effective propagation and scaling. Proposal titles should begin with either &#8220;Research:&#8221; or &#8220;Design and Development:&#8221; as appropriate. Research Projects Research proposals are particularly welcome in the following areas: Research that addresses lifelong learning by the engineering workforce. Research on the impact of engineering education research. Proposals addressing this topic could investigate questions such as: How can we measure the impacts of engineering education research? What are effective strategies for scaling reforms? How can we translate knowledge from research to practice? What are the roles of technologies, networks and communities in achieving impact? RFE does not support efficacy, effectiveness, or scale-up studies for specific interventions. Research that addresses culture change in engineering education. Included in this topic are investigations of normative cultures of engineering at any level in the engineering education ecosystem and how these cultures may disadvantage certain groups. Research that addresses engineering formation at the two-year college and graduate education levels in both formal and informal settings. Research that investigates engineering in P?12 settings. Research in this area could include understanding of approaches to engineering in P?12, how to develop engineering ways of thinking, or the relationship between practices within the sciences and mathematics and engineering thinking. Research on the transitions between education levels, e.g., from high school to two-year college, high school to four-year college/university, two-year college to four-year college/university, undergraduate to graduate school, education settings to the workforce or professoriate, etc. Research that addresses the relationship between engineering and the public. Proposals addressing this topic could consider the social impact of engineering solutions, citizen engineering, education of an informed public, etc. Research that develops or adapts novel methodologies and frameworks appropriate for studying the professional formation of engineers, and especially minoritized, marginalized, or underserved populations. Research that addresses ways in which new technologies (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning) are changing engineering education. Proposals submitted to the Research Projects category should have clear research questions informed by an appropriate theoretical framework and a research design that includes sampling, data collection, and data analysis methods. This category will not support proposals that seek funding primarily to develop tools, curriculum, or laboratories, or that seek to implement classroom innovations that have already been shown to be effective in engineering. The program will evaluate the value of proposals by considering the impact and the cost. Research track projects that are small, exploratory, or speculative are especially encouraged. Larger Research track projects should have a correspondingly larger impact. Design and Development Projects RFE supports Design and Development projects (see https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf13126) that seek to develop and test new approaches in the following areas: Graduate education. Transitions between education levels, e.g. high school to two year college, high school to 4 year college/university, two year college to 4 year college/university, undergraduate to graduate school, education settings to the workforce or professoriate, etc. K12, especially approaches to develop engineering thinking, or providing links between engineering, science, and mathematics Proposals in this category should propose the design and development of new approaches that are informed by existing literature and theory. There should be clear objectives and the evaluation plan should be designed to determine if those objectives have been met. Projects cannot be solely demonstration projects, but must add to the engineering education literature to inform future work.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) provides application guidance for both competitive programs. Eligible grant proposals are shared with the AFWA National Grants Committee (NGC) for review and ranking to aid in the selection process. Proposals must address eligible activities in one or more of the selected AFWA Strategic Priorities to be considered. Strategic Priorities are annually selected by AFWA to establish the State fish and wildlife agencies&apos; (States) conservation priorities (under T-MSCGP) or national recruitment priorities (under R3-MSCGP), and they are used to guide proposal development and grant selection for the programs. The primary goal of both programs is to provide grant funds to address regional or national priority needs of the States and their partners that are beyond the scope and capabilities of a single State. Projects selected and awarded are annually published in the Federal Register. Lists of past awards are also available from the Service and AFWA (see Section G, Federal Awarding Agency Contacts). Recipients awarded under T-MSCGP may use the funds for sport fisheries and wildlife management including research projects, boating access development, hunter safety and education, aquatic education, fish and wildlife habitat improvements, and other purposes consistent with the enabling legislation. Recipients awarded under the R3-MSCGP can only use the funds for making hunter recruitment and recreational shooter recruitment projects that promote a national hunting and shooting sport recruitment program, including related communication and outreach activities.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To become certified, the law enforcement agency must meet two mandatory conditions: (1) the agency&amp;rsquo;s use-of-force policies adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and (2) the agency&amp;rsquo;s use-of-force policies prohibit chokeholds except in situations where use of deadly force is allowed by law. The certification requirement also applies to law enforcement agencies receiving DOJ discretionary grant funding through a subaward. For detailed information on this certification requirement, please visit https://cops.usdoj.gov/SafePolicingEO to access the Standards for Certification on Safe Policing for Safe Communities, the Implementation Fact Sheet, and the List of Designated Independent Credentialing Bodies. Foreign governments, foreign organizations, and foreign colleges and universities are not eligible to apply. Federal agencies are eligible to apply.

With this solicitation, NIJ seeks proposals for rigorous research and evaluation projects targeted toward developing a better understanding of the domestic radicalization phenomenon, and advancing evidence-based strategies for effective intervention and prevention. NIJ seeks proposals in four topics as they relate to radicalization to violent extremism under this solicitation: Research to inform terrorism prevention efforts. Research on disengagement, deradicalization and reintegration. Evaluations of programs and practices. Research on countering mis-, dis-, and mal-information. NIJ is particularly interested in proposals that explore the radicalization of Americans to white nationalist extremism and identify and advance evidence-based strategies for effective intervention and prevention. Wherever possible, funded projects should apply an approach that engages researchers and practitioners in an active partnership to develop more effective solutions to specific problems and to produce transportable lessons and strategies that may help other localities with similar problems. Applications proposing research involving partnerships with criminal justice or other agencies, should include a strong letter of support, signed by an appropriate decision-making authority from each proposed, partnering agency. A letter of support should include the partnering agency&#8217;s acknowledgement that de-identified data derived from, provided to, or obtained through this project will be archived by the grant recipient with the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) at the conclusion of the award. Applicants and their potential partners are encouraged to review the NACJD&#8217;s policies and protections at (NACJD). If selected for award, grantees will be expected to have a formal agreement in place with partnering agencies by January 1, 2023. That formal agreement must include a provision to meet the data archiving requirements of the award. In the case of partnerships that will involve the use of federal award funds by multiple partnering agencies to carry out the proposed project, only one entity/partnering agency may be the applicant (as is the case with any application submitted in response to this solicitation); any others must be proposed as subrecipients.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Applicants must have a demonstrated expertise in developing and implementing programs related to journalism training, designing and carrying-out study tours for university administrators and media professionals, and organizing trainings at U.S. schools of journalism/mass communication. Expertise and established relationships with higher education institutions/journalism schools in Georgia will be considered favorably. The grantee is expected to coordinate the solicitation process of the program participants, including placement at a U.S. school of journalism/mass communication, with PD Section. To mitigate risk because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, grantee will be asked to work with PD Section Tbilisi to enable alternate or supplemental virtual delivery of certain segments of the program in the event of COVID-19 travel restrictions. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Public Diplomacy Section (PD) of the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is pleased to announce an open competition for a Media Education Program (MEP) &#8211; &#8220;Strengthening Journalism Education in Georgia.&#8221; U.S. non-profit/non-governmental organizations and accredited American higher education institutions may submit proposals to manage a year-long project to support the professional development of Georgian media educators from public and private higher education institutions through a robust professional study tour at U.S. schools of journalism, media and mass-communication, with complementary site visits to U.S.-based media organizations and journalism education associations, e.g., Journalism Education Association, etc.. Additional means for achieving objectives of the program may include participation in annual conventions or conferences promoting excellence in journalism education and media literacy. Proposals should include a component to engage approximately 40 MEP alumni through the MEP Alumni Association. This might include a micro-grant opportunity to encourage alumni projects that advance journalism education and media literacy. The applicant should work closely with PD Section throughout the grant period to identify Georgian participants. The project will award $249,900 to defray the costs of a two- week intensive study tour for up to 10 participants. Applicants should include provisions for non-English speaking participants and secure international travel insurance for duration of the study tour. OBJECTIVES The purpose of the Georgian Media Education Program is to support the professional development of media educators, strengthen journalism programs in Georgian HEIs through adopting the best practices of journalism education in the United States, and establish collaborative linkages between Georgian and U.S. schools of journalism. These visits should also demonstrate the important role quality journalism education plays in establishing and maintaining a vibrant press corps and accountable democracy. The program should focus on introducing MEP participants to the latest trends in journalism education, multimedia and media literacy. In today&#8217;s consumer-driven and media saturated world, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly important for teachers to understand how to teach media literacy. Media educators can play a significant role in helping students understand the differences in media outlets, the messages they receive and ethical methods for producing their own content. Apart from consultation meetings with professors and media administrators, campus tour and intensive hands-on trainings at a selected U.S. school of journalism/communication, participation in events and workshops organized by professional journalism organizations should help achieve the program objectives. Exposure to emerging media tools, instruments, and digital platforms would enable selected Georgian media educators to learn modern practices in journalism education and to successfully adopt them in their professions. The program will also enable media professionals to examine technological advances in an American university and the influence it has on expanding academic opportunities for the educational achievement. The MEP has provided professional development to three previous cohorts comprising about 40 journalism educators, who remain active through a newly developed alumni association. MEP proposal may entail a component that ensures continued alumni engagement. Funds up to $15,000 can be encumbered to support a micro-grant competition through which alumni may submit proposals that will strengthen their programs. The program envisages exchanges in both directions &#8211; a combination of trips to the United States for Georgian participants and trips to Georgia of American partners, who will be engaged in active trainings on specific topics identified in consultation with MEP participants. For the visits to Georgia, activities should focus on completing those activities conducted in the United States and increasing the professional capacity of the Georgian participants and their colleagues who may not travel to the United States. EXPECTED RESULTS The program should emphasize hands-on experience that will build the professional expertise of Georgian media educators and contribute to strengthening journalism education in Georgia. It will also help journalism professors get acquainted with strategies for teaching media literacy and supporting students in developing skills that allow them to effectively evaluate content from a variety of media sources. The program may include such topics as: &#183; Curriculum and instruction (including course design and curriculum development for BA and MA programs in journalism and mass communication, multimedia journalism, digital media and strategic communications); &#183; Assessment of student learning outcomes; &#183; Course evaluation and accreditation of media programs; &#183; Modern textbooks, journalism coursework and curriculum designs, e-libraries; &#183; Media Literacy teaching/ resources and increasing digital literacy skills; &#183; Social media and Multimedia teaching; &#183; Online programs for journalism, development of online course design; &#183; Faculty development; Journalism Education Association: JEA mission and standards of media education; &#183; Student internship and support; &#183; Teaching academic writing for journalism students; &#183; Media school partnerships and student exchanges; &#183; Multidisciplinary teaching and use of integrated methods (academic research combined with practical work); &#183; Current trends and &#8220;hot button&#8221; issues in journalism education Applicants may propose other project topics/activities not specifically mentioned in this solicitation if the activities reinforce the impact of the project. A detailed program timeline for the entire grant period that outlines how components unfold and complement each other must be included in the proposal. The names of proposed Georgian participants must be reviewed and approved in advance of U.S. travel by the Public Diplomacy (PD) Section of the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi. PD Section anticipates that the majority of Georgian participants will not have working-level competency in English. The applicant should describe the provisions (interpretation, international travel insurance, visa B1/B2 fee, meals and incidental expenses) that will be made for the proposed study tour participants.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>3</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To become certified, the law enforcement agency must meet two mandatory conditions: (1) the agency&amp;rsquo;s use-of-force policies adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and (2) the agency&amp;rsquo;s use-of-force policies prohibit chokeholds except in situations where use of deadly force is allowed by law. The certification requirement also applies to law enforcement agencies receiving DOJ discretionary grant funding through a subaward. For detailed information on this certification requirement, please visit https://cops.usdoj.gov/SafePolicingEO to access the Standards for Certification on Safe Policing for Safe Communities, the Implementation Fact Sheet, and the List of Designated Independent Credentialing Bodies.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). Program Overview: The program goal of CURIE is to enable commercially viable reprocessing of used nuclear fuel (UNF) from the current light water reactor (LWR) fleet by resolving key gaps/barriers in reprocessing technologies, process monitoring, and facility design. The actinides in LWR UNF would ideally be reprocessed into feedstock that would be used to fuel advanced nuclear reactors (ARs), while other commercially valuable materials would be harvested for industrial and medical uses. Projects funded under CURIE will develop innovative separations technologies, process monitoring techniques for special nuclear material (SNM ), and/or equipment designs that will significantly improve the economics and process monitoring of reprocessing technologies while dramatically reducing the volume of high-level waste (HLW) from LWR UNF requiring disposal (see Section I.D, &#8220;Program Objectives&#8221;). Specifically, CURIE is interested in separations technologies, process monitoring to enable predictive material accountancy, innovative equipment designs, and systems analyses that satisfy one or more of the global program metrics without negatively impacting other program metrics: (1) significantly (i.e., at least an order of magnitude) reduce the volume of LWR HLW requiring permanent disposal, (2) maintain disposal costs in the range of 0.1&#162;/kilowatt-hour (kWh) , (3) provide a 1&#162;/kWh fuel cost for a 200 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM)/yr nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) facility, (4) enable in situ SNM process monitoring approaches that predict, within 1% uncertainty and under representative conditions, the post-process material accountancy, and (5) enable UNF separations that do not produce pure plutonium streams. In aggregate, these metrics are envisioned to support a commercially viable reprocessing technology that would provide valuable AR fuel feedstock and the ability to recover fission products of interest (e.g., precious metals and medical radioisotopes) while minimizing the Nation&#8217;s HLW waste impact. CURIE is part of a comprehensive, nearly $90 million ARPA-E strategy to manage and reduce the Nation&#8217;s HLW waste inventory and is designed to complement the ARPA-E ONWARDS program. While both the ONWARDS and CURIE programs seek to enable innovations that will minimize HLW quantities, CURIE focuses on the development of technologies that will enable UNF from the current LWR fleet to be utilized as feedstock for future nuclear fuel.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). The program goal of CURIE is to enable commercially viable reprocessing of used nuclear fuel (UNF) from the current light water reactor (LWR) fleet by resolving key gaps/barriers in reprocessing technologies, process monitoring, and facility design. The actinides in LWR UNF would ideally be reprocessed into feedstock that would be used to fuel advanced nuclear reactors (ARs), while other commercially valuable materials would be harvested for industrial and medical uses. Projects funded under CURIE will develop innovative separations technologies, process monitoring techniques for special nuclear material (SNM ), and/or equipment designs that will significantly improve the economics and process monitoring of reprocessing technologies while dramatically reducing the volume of high-level waste (HLW) from LWR UNF requiring disposal (see Section I.C, &#8220;Program Objectives&#8221;).

Program DescriptionProgram PurposeThis funding opportunity is for the Interventional Cooperative Agreement Program (ICAP). Through the ICAP, SSA collaborates with States, private foundations, and other non-federal groups and organizations who have the interest and ability to identify, operate, and partially fund interventional research. The research and interventions under this program will target the increased employment and self-sufficiency of individuals with disabilities, including people of color and underserved communities (whether beneficiaries, applicants, or potential applicants of the Disability Insurance (DI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs); coordinating planning between private and public human services agencies to improve the administration and effectiveness the DI, SSI, and related programs; assisting claimants in underserved communities apply for or appeal decisions on claims for DI and SSI benefits; and conducting outreach to children with disabilities who are potentially eligible to receive SSI.SSA intends the projects to have a project period of up to 5 years, with the first year used to put any necessary data agreements into place, recruit additional partners (including any collaborators including sub-contractors or sub-awardees), and conduct any other implementation planning activities. If the project is able to meet these milestones in the first year, funding will be continued to field and evaluate the project for up to four years.Priority Topics of interestProposals must address goals under at least one of the following priority topics. Proposals should identify the priority topic(s) the proposed intervention(s) will address and explain how the intervention would address the priority topic(s).&#8226; Eliminating the structural barriers in the labor market for people with disabilities and other underserved communities. &#8226; Promoting self-sufficiency by helping people enter, stay in, or return to the labor force, including transition-age youth. &#8226; Coordinating planning between private and public human services agencies to improve the administration and effectiveness the DI, SSI, and related programs. &#8226; Assisting claimants in underserved communities apply for or appeal decisions on claims for DI and SSI benefits; and &#8226; Conducting outreach to children with disabilities who are potentially eligible to receive SSI.II. Award InformationType of AwardSSA expects to award at least two awards totaling up to $3 million (each) in cooperative agreements under this request for applications (RFA). The total amount awarded and the number of awards will be determined based on the strength of the applications received and programmatic and budgetary considerations. SSA reserves the right to determine the number of awards, make no awards, or to make awards for amounts less than the amounts requested by the applicants.Cooperative agreements require close cooperation and coordination between SSA and the awardees. SSA will have substantial involvement in the administration of the cooperative agreement, and SSA&#8217;s input and approval is required before conducting most activities.Award Amount and Period of PerformanceSSA will determine a proposal&#8217;s funding eligibility and level of funding based upon the evidence rating that currently exists for the proposed intervention or would likely be attained for the proposed intervention. SSA will also consider the efficacy (strength) of the proposed intervention. The determination of will be based on the level of causal evidence the chosen study design is likely to produce, as well as any existing causal evidence for the proposed intervention.An intervention for which there is a high level of causal evidence or a high likelihood of generating causal evidence, as identified using the criteria mentioned above, for up to 5 years with a total of up to $3 million from SSA. Feasibility studies, i.e., interventions with no causal evidence or a weak causal design as identified using the criteria mentioned above, may be funded up to $1.5 million. Base year spending (i.e., the spending for the first year of the award) for either study type should be no more than $250,000 or 10% of the total budget, whichever is greater.Applications with budgets including expectations of funding from SSA exceeding the ceiling will be deemed non-responsive and will not be considered. SSA will only consider one application per lead organization. The agreements will have one base year with the option to fund up to four (minimum two) additional years of the project. The one-year base period of each cooperative agreement will support the development of data sharing agreements, project planning, evaluation design, and other administrative aspects of the agreement. If, at the end of the first year, or sooner if the necessary agreements and other planning and administrative aspects are in place, the planning process results in an evaluable project, as determined by SSA, cooperative agreements may be extended for up to four additional years during which the awardee will implement and evaluate the intervention. Proposals must include a discussion of the level of causal evidence the chosen study design is likely to produce, as well as any existing causal evidence for the proposed intervention. We will use the criteria from the Department of Labor&#8217;s Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) (https://clear.dol.gov/), the Department of Education&#8217;s What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) ( https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/), the Administration for Children and Families&#8217; Pathways to Work Evidence Clearinghouse ( https://pathwaystowork.acf.hhs.gov/), and other similar clearinghouses to determine the level of each proposal&#8217;s claims of, and likelihood of producing, causal evidence. If the proposed project builds on any prior research that has been previously reviewed and rated by a clearinghouse, such information should be included in the project narrative. More information can be found in reference documents for the CLEAR, WWC, and Pathways to Work Evidence Clearinghouse review process. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Revised forecast to reflect no cost share or match requirement for the FY&apos;22 ICAP application.</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

In 1997, in collaboration with the American Association of Neuropathologists (AANP), the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center was established to enhance national CJD surveillance and to make possible laboratory investigation of newly emerging prion diseases. This pathology center, currently located at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, provided the services of a cutting edge prion disease laboratory, filling a critical public health gap for monitoring prion diseases in humans. Brain tissues and clinical laboratory information on clinically suspected and diagnosed cases of human prion disease have been evaluated at the NPDPSC for approximately 20 years to confirm diagnoses and determine the type of prion disease, including whether the patients had variant CJD or some other possible emerging prion disease in the United States. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the founding partners of the GPEI, providing technical and financial support (https://polioeradication.org/). Polio eradication remains an agency-wide priority; CDC&apos;s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has been activated since December 2011 to support global polio response activities. The GPEI has made tremendous progress toward global WPV eradication, from 125 countries in 1988 to two countries in 2021. WPV types 2 and 3 have been eradicated and only WPV type 1 (WPV1) remains. Of WHO&#8217;s six Regions, only the Eastern Mediterranean Region remains affected. The GPEI faces two major challenges: 1) continued transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan and 2) increasing number of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPVs) which result from prolonged transmission in under-immunized communities of the live weakened virus from the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). GPEI&#8217;s newest strategy, Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026: Delivering on a Promise, outlines how the partnership intends to address these challenges. Concurrently, GPEI must begin planning now for the future of a polio-free world. Current planning is that within 12 months of certification of WPV eradication, all OPVs will be removed from essential immunization programs (i.e., OPV cessation). The risk of emergence of VDPVs will be highest in the first two years after OPV cessation as intestinal mucosal immunity needed to stop virus transmission wanes. The risk of accidental introduction in communities and the environment by a containment breach from a poliovirus essential facility (PEF), such as a poliovirus vaccine manufacturer, will persist as long as live polioviruses are maintained at facilities. Numerous key questions remain about interrupting cVDPV transmission in the near-term, and the long-term needs of poliovirus surveillance. For cVDPV interruption, the focus is on which factor or combination of factors would optimize field-level response strategies to quickly interrupt transmission and associated costs. Questions on long-term surveillance needs include the optimal mix of poliovirus surveillance systems and activities that will be sustainable yet sensitive to detect emergence of VDPV and associated costs. In countries that have PEFs, questions are focused on the types of surveillance activities that should be implemented to ensure surveillance sensitivity around the PEF. Statistical and mathematical modeling would be an informative approach to address these questions. CDC has almost 20 years of experience working with modelers to address complex polio eradication issues to inform GPEI policymaking through cooperative agreements (NU2RGH001913, NU2RGH001915). Further expansion of the portfolio of models available to CDC is needed to include models that inform the most efficient and cost-effective field-level operations for outbreak response, and poliovirus surveillance needs in the post-certification era. In parallel, there is a recognized need for expanding the role of modeling to inform public health strategies and goals. CDC supports the growth of a diverse public health workforce and aims to provide collaborative opportunities to students to gain hands-on training and translation of their work to action. The benefit of such a collaboration will also increase modeling literacy among CDC staff.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Pain and other symptoms associated with gynecologic disorders are often overlooked and not addressed, causing women to feel unheard. Furthermore, endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS increase the risk of pregnancy complications and adverse maternal outcomes including gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and placenta previa. The anticipated goals of this funding opportunity are to: (1) Design programs to identify, implement, refine, and evaluate evidence-based interventions and strategies and comprehensively diagnose and treat endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS associated with painful or irregular periods in women in underserved communities that contribute to risk factors and inequities in maternal morbidity; (2) Identify and track evidence-based outcomes to demonstrate improvements in early diagnosis and effective treatment of endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS. Such outcomes, such as improvements in blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, or insulin sensitivity, are aligned with the Administration&#8217;s goals in improving health outcomes for women in underserved communities; and (3) Gather stories of women who felt unheard after reporting symptoms associated with endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS that were overlooked and undiagnosed, interventions that improved their clinical outcomes inclusive of mental health, and how the intervention through the grant changed their course of treatment in an evidence-based manner. OWH anticipates project periods of up to 3 years in annual budget periods. Recipients will be required to submit a non-competing continuation application for each budget period after the first. Funding for the budget periods after the first will be contingent upon availability of funding, satisfactory performance (including recipient progress towards meeting stated project milestones and goals, timely submission of required reports, and compliance with all grant terms and conditions), and the best interests of the government. OWH anticipates offering a competitive fourth year for the purpose of providing limited funding to support selected projects in their transition to sustainability.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Modified Dates</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Early detection of these conditions, whose symptoms are not clinically observable at birth, save thousands of infants and children from disability and death through early detection and treatment. With this 2-year funding opportunity, CDC intends to support up to 8 state or territorial newborn screening laboratories to add HHS ACHDNC-recommended newborn screening conditions to their newborn screening panel. CDC intends to work collaboratively with recipients to enhance state and territorial newborn screening laboratory capability to implement these and future HHS ACHDNC -recommended newborn screening conditions. CDC also intends to work collaboratively with recipients to improve the quality of newborn screening testing in the U.S., in part through data harmonization efforts. This funding will result in a greater number of newborns that are appropriately screened, identified, and referred for treatment for condition detected through state newborn dried blood spot screening.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Topics A, C, and D require the use of high fidelity, multi-qubit devices, such as gate-defined SiGe or MOS quantum dots or high fidelity multi-qubit superconducting qubit devices to achieve their objectives. Such qubits can be available in-house by the proposing team, via collaborations funded as part of this BAA and/or sourced from a suitable proven qubit foundry. High fidelity refers to the demonstrated ability to implement state-of-the-art low error universal quantum gates and low error readout. Using such qubits, these topics explore novel control techniques (C), noise (D), and information distribution schemes (A).In contrast, topic B focuses on new spin and superconducting qubits which have a demonstrated superior performance metric when compared to standard leading gate-based qubits. Superior may be defined in relation to a particular performance metric, without sacrificing other important performance metrics (e.g., T1, T2, valley splitting, environmental requirements, etc.). The goal of topic B is to develop high fidelity multi-qubit gate schemes for such qubits.Following topics which fall outside this call and will not be considered for award:1) Atomic and molecular systems (e.g., neutral atoms, trapped ions)2) Optical photon-based QC3) Systems without a path to universal 1 and 2 qubit gates4) Immature qubits which have yet to demonstrate a superior performance metric in leading solid-state qubit approaches, without sacrificing performance in other metrics relevant to gate-based quantum computing5) Quantum simulators or simulations6) Quantum annealing, measurement-based QC or other non-gate-based QC approaches (exceptions may be granted for specific application areas, e.g. entanglement generation)Multi-disciplinary teams are encouraged in response to each topic area. Examples of expertise which should be considered as part of each team includes theory, simulation, materials, fabrication and experimental.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>A minor change was made to the POC.</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

As an NSF broadening participation emphasis program, AISL recognizes that an intentional and explicit strategy that advances equity is key to effectively building research and practice capacity in the informal STEM learning field. To that end, the National Science Foundation seeks proposals to create an AISL Equity Resource Center (AERC) to advance equity within the informal STEM learning field through community building; supporting and extending infrastructures; technical assistance; and communications. For the purposes of this solicitation, the program does not define or bound the concept of equity. Instead, this call allows the proposer to both define equity in relation to the needs of informal STEM learning field and design and deploy creative approaches that promote equity across the informal STEM learning field. Overall, the AISL program seeks an AERC that will serve public and professional communities in the informal STEM learning field through the following functions: Cultivate a multi-sector, diverse community dedicated to promoting equity in informal STEM learning experiences and environments. Raise the visibility and impact of equity-focused research and practice in the informal STEM learning field and its contributions to the overall STEM endeavor. Support AISL PIs, prospective PIs, and partners in enacting their commitments to equity with respect to research and practice. Promote equitable practices that support the AISL program. Through these functions, the AISL program seeks to make clear that advancing equity is imperative to advancing informal STEM learning experiences and environments and their value to individuals, communities, and the nation. The primary audiences for AERC are individuals and organizations that want to grow their ability to design and conduct equity-focused, evidence-based innovations in informal STEM research, programming, or both. The stakeholders served by the center should include, but are not limited to, AISL PIs and partners; prospective AISL PIs and partners; and additional equity-focused, evidence-based research and practice innovators in informal STEM. AERC should envision, design, and develop creative strategies for actualizing equity in the informal STEM learning field. The AERC approaches to leadership, activities, and evaluation should similarly enact commitments to equity. AISL has had a resource center since 2007. The award for the current AISL resource center expires in August 2022; this solicitation updates the existing functions for an AISL resource center.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The fund is designed to meet critical refugee protection and assistance needs, filling gaps not addressed by other organizations. The initiative seeks to provide U.S. Ambassadors the means to respond to critical programming gaps that have not been addressed in larger multilateral refugee programs.Per 7008 restrictions, the U.S. government is prohibited from providing assistance to the Government of Guinea (including local institutions, such as schools and local government representatives) until a democratically elected government is installed. Projects cannot involve the participation of government officials or employees serving in their official capacity or occur in government-owned facilities.ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND FUNDING GUIDELINESThe funds are meant to support projects that assist refugees or refugee returnees.&#8226; The Taft Refugee Fund is intended for projects that include a target beneficiary base of at least 50 percent refugees or returnees.&#8226; Requests to provide funding to populations other than refugees/returnees are discouraged, but exceptions can be made in some regions with &#8220;populations of concern&#8221; to PRM, such as internally displaced persons (IDPs), vulnerable migrants, and stateless persons.&#8226; PRM seeks to support local organizations to support equal access to protection, assistance, and other solutions for LGBTQI+ refugees and stateless persons.&#8226; Consideration for support is also given to projects that benefit both populations of concern and their host communities.&#8226; The fund is not meant as an emergency fund and these should be one-time interventions, not sustained programs.&#8226; Applicants must be a registered organization, such as an NGO, community-based organization, or faith-based organization.&#8226; National/local NGOs will be given priority.

An announcement is not related to this notice. The U.S. State Department&#8217; s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) is not accepting applications at this time. Please review the attached notice for full details. Background: The goal of the Program to End Modern Slavery (PEMS) is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking in targeted populations in partner countries and jurisdictions through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships. PEMS-funded efforts conduct scientifically rigorous research to establish evidence on the effects of anti-trafficking programs on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking through the advancement of sound prevalence measurement methodologies, strong monitoring and evaluation practices, evidence-based programming, and the application of victim-centered and trauma-informed approaches. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 for PEMS, totaling $150 million to date. The TIP Office is interested in funding research and implementation projects focused on five priority areas as they relate to human trafficking: &#8226; Supply Chains &#8226; Climate Change and Displacement &#8226; Public Health &#8226; Financial Inclusion &#8226; Sex Trafficking PEMS encourages the use of partnerships with governments, academia, civil society, the private sector, other funders, and international organizations to advance the goals of the program and improve collaboration on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking. The TIP Office anticipates that a Statement of Interest (SOI) will be released within the next couple of months on SAMS-Domestic and grants.gov followed by a Notification of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Modified tentative start dates.</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

It directed the FDA to establish standards for adoption of modern animal food safety prevention practices by those who grow, process, transport, and store food. Congress recognized that the more than 3,000 state, local, territorial, and tribal government agencies involved in food safety, including animal food safety, must be fully integrated in FDA&apos;s work to fulfill FSMA&apos;s mandate that consumers be protected by an animal food safety system based on prevention and risk.

Radon is an odorless, colorless radioactive gas which is a decay product of elements in soil and rock and is present in every part of the country. Low levels of radon are found in the outside air; however, radon gas can move through the soil and enter buildings through small openings in the foundation or basement and become concentrated in the indoor air. When radon is inhaled it releases radiation that can damage lung tissue, and in doing so, increase the risk of developing lung cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that approximately 21,000 people die in the U.S. annually due to lung cancer from radon exposure[1].

Critical advances in the treatment of brain disorders in human populations are hindered by our lack of ability to monitor and manipulate circuitry in safe, minimally-invasive ways. Clinical intervention with novel cell and circuit specific tools will require extensive focused research designed to remove barriers to delivery of gene therapies. In addition to identification and removal of barriers, the need to specifically target dysfunctional circuitry poses additional challenges. Neuroscience has experienced an impressive influx of exciting new research tools in the past decade, especially since the launch of the BRAIN Initiative. However, the majority of these cutting edge tools have been developed for use in model organisms, primarily rodents, fish and flies. These cutting edge tools, such as viral delivery of genetic constructs, are increasingly adaptable to large brains and more importantly are emerging as potential human therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. A pressing need to develop tools for use in large brains, more directly relevant to the human brain is the focus of this initiative. The new tools and technologies should inform and/or exploit cell-type and/or circuit-level specificity. Plans for validating the utility of the tool/technology will be an essential feature of a successful application. The development of new genetic and non-genetic tools for delivering genes, proteins and chemicals to cells of interest or approaches that are expected to target specific cell types and/or circuits in the nervous system with greater precision and sensitivity than currently established methods are encouraged.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The long pond is located on the former Germania golf course which is now part of the Refuge. The long pond is a former irrigation pond located near the Tittabawassee River and in it&apos;s current condition has steep vertical walls and provides little to no habitat value and poses a safety concern for visitors to the Refuge. The Service seeks to award this cooperative agreement to an entity that can survey they existing pond, develop a restoration design in collaboration with the Service which will connect the long pond to the Tittabawassee River and soften the existing vertical banks of the long pond. Preliminary estimates show that this may require relocating up to 20,000 cubic yards of earth. This site is located within the floodplain of the Tittabawasee River and the design will require direction and oversight from the Service to ensure that the design complies with all State and Federal wetland/floodplain/clean water act permits. The Service has already held pre-appplication meetings with local, State, and Federal regulators to ensure this project is permitable and complient with existing laws. The awardee will provide a complete set of design plans that will be used by the Service to apply for local, State, and Federal permits. Furthermore, this project will involve removal of several miles of asphalt golf cart paths that run throughout the entire former golf course. Once all permits have been issued the awardee will provide construction management to complete the project. Construction management services will include: Development of a federal procurement compliant bid package and solicitation of bids from sub-contractors to complete the work of the long pond and removal of cart paths. Provide construction management, oversight, and on-site inspections of all aspects of construction to ensure all aspects of the project are built to design specifications. Ensure all contractors wash and clean equipment prior to entering Refuge (as outlined in the design plans) to prevent invasive species spread. Ensure all fuel stored on the Refuge by sub-contractors is compliant with the Service policy for fuel storage and containment. Ensure any damage to existing Refuge infrastructure (roads, trails, signs, gates, observation platforms) are repaired to pre-construction condition (this may include but not limited to road grading and dike repair upon completion of the project). Routinely communicate construction activities, timelines, and any issues that may cause delays with the Service program officer. Provide final survey of project to the Service in an ArcGIS and AutoCAD compatible format. The Service will be substantially involved in this project through the following: Provide all local, state, and federal construction and environmental permits. Provide on-site local knowledge of area and conditions. The Service will work with the awardee and subcontractors to develop a timeline for construction activities that considers: wildlife disturbance, flooding and/or changing river levels, daytime and any proposed night time operations (must be approved in advance), and public use (e.g., hiking trails, observation platforms, and any other public use that may be impacted). The Service will approve all haul routes and the Service must approve roads that can be used by awardee and their subcontractor prior to construction, any requests for alternative routes must be approved in advance. Any organization that would like to see the project area in person much contact the Service program officer listed in the NOFO no later than 10 days prior to the closing of the announcement to schedule a site visit.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Future computing systems with ultra-low energy storage can be built on principles derived from organic systems that are at the intersection of biology, physics, chemistry, materials science, computer science and engineering. Next-generation information storage technologies can be envisioned that are driven by biological principles with use of biomaterials in the fabrication of devices and systems that can store data for more than 100 years with storage capacity 1,000 times more than current storage technologies. Such a research effort can have a significant impact on the future of information storage technologies. This focused solicitation seeks high-risk/high- return interdisciplinary research on novel concepts and enabling technologies that will address the fundamental scientific issues and technological challenges associated with the underpinnings of synthetic biology integrated with semiconductor technology. This research will foster interactions among various disciplines including biology, physics, chemistry, materials science, computer science and engineering that will enable in heretofore-unanticipated breakthroughs. INFORMATIONAL WEBINAR: The SemiSynBio-III program will host an informational webinar in March 2022 to discuss and answer questions about the solicitation.

This project will create and improve structures for reporting workplace harassment, particularly harassment against women, in local organizations in and around Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. Over a period of 18 months, the implementing organization should work with 20 to 25 small and medium local organizations of various types to help their Human Resource (HR) personnel and/or departments design, develop, and/or improve internal processes, policies, and manuals to make the reporting of workplace harassment easier and safer. Under this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), proposals should also impart training workshops for employees, HR Departments, workplace harassment committees, and senior management. Training should be determined based on a research-led needs analysis and best practices from U.S. organizations such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but at a minimum would implement workplace harassment manuals, policies, and reporting structures. The project should provide comprehensive support to the local organizations as they implement the newly developed policies, manuals, and structures. In addition to training content, projects should also produce engaging supplementary materials, such as digital and static posters and graphics that local organizations can use. In addition to working with the local organizations, the project implementer should develop exemplar digital trainings, posters, and manuals based on best practices, including from the United States, and tailored appropriately for local audiences, to be made available online to the public free of cost, to raise public awareness. The timeframe for achieving the objectives must be clearly outlined in the proposal funding request. The project implementation period should be 18 months. Proposals have a funding floor of $125,000 and a funding ceiling of $150,000.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The goal of this solicitation is to enable and create opportunities to advance scientific discoveries and new research using a variety of approaches that harness the national talent ecosystem of experienced faculty. Recognizing that a successful faculty research career is neither linear nor continuous, this BRITE solicitation seeksproposals that enable experienced researchers and scholars (tenured or equivalent) to forge new directions or to enter new fields by capitalizing or branching out of their established knowledge domains. All BRITE proposals are expected to address fundamental research that creates new knowledge in one or more CMMI program areas. BRITE proposals must identify key research outcomes and describe the research plans for the period of funding sought. Although collaborative proposals are not permitted and will be returned without review, the PI can include a collaborator in a limited role as senior personnel. The solicitation includes four funding tracks: Synergy, Pivot, Relaunch, and Fellow in support of experienced scientists and engineers (tenured or equivalent). The BRITE Synergy Track is intended to support synthesis research borne out of a disaggregated and accumulated body of prior research outcomes that remain unstudied and unprobed to forge or conceptualize a novel direction, methodology, paradigm, or outcome that is more than the sum of the parts. The BRITE Pivot Track is intended to enable researchers to quickly adapt to the fast-moving pace of research and create new knowledge and research products in their field by infusing new concepts from a different discipline or sub-field. The BRITE Relaunch Track is intended to support tenured or equivalent faculty, who have had a pause in research activity, to relaunch back into active research, and to diversify the experiences of the nation&#8217;s STEM researchers. The BRITE Fellow Track is intended to support established tenured or equivalent researchers who have demonstrated impact beyond scientific output to request extended time and freedom to use their intellectual creativity to explore divergent, bold, and ambitious research ideas where the expected scientific outcomes are highly uncertain and, therefore, high-risk. PIs interested in submitting to the Synergy, Pivot, or Fellow track are strongly encouraged to assess the suitability of their proposal topic prior to submission. All funded projects will form an NSF BRITE cohort and investigators will participate in NSF-organized convenings in the form of an annual review. The expected funding ranges for BRITE Research Grants are: $100,000-$200,000 per year The award duration is 2 years for the BRITE Synergy track awards, 3 years for the BRITE Pivot and Relaunch tracks, and 5 years for the Fellow track awards. Variations from the typical durations will be considered with a clearly stated justification. BRITE proposals responding to this solicitation must include additional sections within the 15-page Project Description entitled: Past Contributions, Research Approach and Research Plan, Track Relevance, Outcomes, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan. Please see &#8220;Full Proposal Preparation Instructions&#8221; for additional details. Investigators who do not align with one of the tracks are not eligible for this solicitation. FURTHER INFORMATION: An informational webinar about this solicitation will be held on February 3rd, 2022 at 2:00 PM ET. Details about how to register and join this webinar are provided below.

Data can be used to inform state and local prevention and response strategies in areas and populations of greatest need. Recipients must undertake 2 activities: Increase the timeliness of aggregate reporting of ED visits for nonfatal firearm injuries. Recipients will share real-time, visit-level syndromic surveillance data with the CDC&#8217;s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (CDC/NCIPC). They will also verify state and county quarterly reports on ED visits for nonfatal firearm injuries, stratified by month, to inform public health response to suspected clusters of these injuries and broader firearm injury and mortality prevention efforts. Disseminate surveillance findings to key stakeholders working to prevent or respond to firearm injuries, including the public. Data shared with CDC will be combined into a multi-state database to support surveillance efforts in other states and provide data to help answer research questions.

The use of engineering principles is encouraged to establish these tools and technologies as robust, well-characterized solutions that fulfill an unmet need. A key change compared with prior Bioengineering Research Partnership FOAs is that BPI applications must include at least one academic and one industrial organization. The purpose of the BPI FOA will be to encourage applications to: 1) establish a robust engineering solution to a problem in biomedical research or the practice of medicine; 2) develop a strategic alliance of multi-disciplinary partners based on a well-defined leadership plan; and 3) realize a specific endpoint within 5-10 years based on a detailed plan with a timeline and quantitative milestones. The areas of research encouraged in this initiative must be consistent with the mission of the IC&apos;s participating in the BPI funding opportunity. This Notice is being provided to allow potential applicants sufficient time to develop meaningful collaborations and responsive projects. The FOA is expected to be published in February 2022 with an expected application due date in May 2022.

CCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies and aims to help eligible low-income working families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. CCDF also aims to improve the quality of care and promote children&#8217;s healthy development and learning by supporting child care licensing, quality improvement systems to help programs meet higher standards, and training and education for child care workers. Analyzing existing data sets may provide researchers an efficient and cost-effective method for answering critical research questions of relevance to CCDF. Findings from these grants are intended to inform policy, program administration, and future research. Topics of particular interest to ACF may include, but are not limited to the following: recruiting and retaining a qualified early care and education workforce; reducing barriers to access and/or improvements in access to ECE, particularly for those most in need of services; consumer education, COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery, building the supply of high-quality care and education; improving teacher and caregiver competencies through professional development; supporting workforce well-being; and approaches to engage, support, and meet the needs of families. Data sets of particular interest to ACF may include, but are not limited to, the 2019 National Survey of Early Care and Education and state or territory-level workforce registry, subsidy, Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), licensing, monitoring, child care resource and referral, or Preschool Development Grants Birth-5 data.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

These grants aim to support researchers conducting secondary analyses of data to address key questions of relevance to Head Start programs and policies. Since the programs&#8217; inception, Head Start and Early Head Start have engaged in a rigorous program of research providing valuable information for guiding program improvements in Head Start and Early Head Start, as well as for the larger field of early childhood programming and development. Head Start and Early Head Start programs have collaborated with researchers to make significant contributions in program innovation and evaluation, as well as the use of systematic data collection, analysis, and interpretation in program operations. Head Start has attracted an extensive network of highly accomplished partners in research firms, universities, and local programs, who strive to answer critical policy questions and improve the quality of the program with rigorous and relevant research. Analyzing existing data sets may provide researchers an efficient and cost-effective method for answering critical research questions of relevance to the goals and outcomes of Head Start and Early Head Start. Findings from these grants are intended to inform policy, program administration, and future research. Topics of particular interest to ACF may include, but are not limited to: building, recruiting, and retaining a qualified workforce; promoting equity and improvements in approaches to reach, recruit, enroll, and sustain families, particularly those most in need of HS services; supporting the unique strengths and needs of MSHS and AIAN HS children, families, and staff; facilitators and barriers to the implementation of new or expansion of existing HS or EHS programs; quality measurement and continuous quality improvement processes; COVID-19 pandemic impact, response, and recovery; improving HS staff competencies through professional development; coordination and collaboration between HS and State, Territory, or local early care and education or social service systems; supports and services for families experiencing homelessness, families involved in the child welfare system, and for children with disabilities; supporting the wellness of staff in the HS workforce; costs associated with delivering HS services and blending/braiding of funding sources; identifying practices or experiences within HS programs that drive child and family outcomes; or approaches to engage, support, and meet the health, mental health, economic self-sufficiency, and other needs of HS families. ACF is particularly interested in secondary analyses that examine the aforementioned topics with an equity and strength-based lens and provide insights into the experiences of HS staff and families from historically underserved or marginalized communities. Data sets of particular interest to ACF may include, but are not limited to the Family and Child Experiences Survey, AIAN Family and Child Experiences Survey, Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey, Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Study, Study of Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, National Survey of Early Care and Education, Office of Head Start Program Information Report, or Preschool Development Grants B-5 state or territory grant recipient administrative data.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Public health surveillance of children with FASDs is essential for understanding the magnitude of these conditions in the population, as well as understanding associated needs, healthcare utilization, and comorbidities. Information from existing healthcare data systems (including electronic medical records and electronic claims databases) are a potential source of surveillance data, but a better understanding of these data, and the processes and pathways by which children with a potential FASD are referred, evaluated, and receive care are needed. This non-research surveillance NOFO will work with clinical sites that have experience evaluating, diagnosing, or providing care to children with FASDs to: (1) identify, describe, and abstract information from data sources that contain relevant healthcare related information about children referred, evaluated, or diagnosed with FASDs; (2) characterize the availability and quality of healthcare related data, as well as opportunities for using healthcare related information for public health surveillance; and (3) describe and assess processes and pathways for identifying, referring, evaluating and diagnosing children with a potential FASD.

This funding opportunity applies to Institutions of Higher Education that in the most recent five calendar years before publication of this solicitation received not more than $5,000,000 total in federal funding for QISE research as described in Focus areas 1, 2, and 3, in Section II &#8220;Program Description&#8221; of this solicitation. The ExpandQISE program helps build and maintain a close connection between new efforts and existing impactful work done at the existing QISE Centers or leading QISE research Institutions, while creating and nurturing necessary critical mass at Institutions not yet fully involved in QISE. In keeping with the NSF goal of increasing the participation of all members of society in the scientific enterprise, institutions at which more than 50% of enrolled students come from groups that are currently under-represented in the sciences, e.g. minority-serving institutions (MSIs), are especially encouraged to apply.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

INTRODUCTION This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a Request for Applications (RFA) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to issue any solicitation or Notice of Funding Opportunity, or ultimately award a contract or assistance agreement on the basis of this RFI, or to pay for any information voluntarily submitted as a result of this request. Responses to this RFI shall not be portrayed as proposals and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government (USG) to form a binding agreement. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It should be noted that responding to or providing comment on this RFI will not give any advantage to any organization in any subsequent procurement. USAID/Ethiopia will not provide answers to any question submitted in response to this request. USAID posts its competitive business opportunities on www.fbo.gov or www.grants.gov. It is the potential offeror&#8217;s/applicant&#8217;s responsibility to monitor these sites for announcements of new opportunities. Responses may be used by USAID without restriction or limitation. II. PURPOSE This RFI on Improving Quality of Health Care Activity solely seeks additional information and inputs from experts, organizations, and/or consortia in the field of quality of health care in general, and in Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCAH) services in particular. The information received will not be publicly released and will only be used to inform planning decisions. Furthermore, USAID/Ethiopia is not at this time seeking applications or proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. USAID/Ethiopia strongly encourages organizations to respond to the questions below after reviewing the draft concept note. Your responses will help USAID to gain a deeper understanding of the quality of care context, current interventions, and approaches for a comprehensive quality improvement program design. Interested parties should provide a short submission, not to exceed 15 pages, addressing the questions below in addition to any comments related to Attachment A. III. QUESTIONS Do the results and sub results lead to the achievement of the Activity objectives? Is the Theory of Change (TOC) logical in demonstrating the right &#8220;if-then&#8221; relationship series or pathway to achieve the stated activity purpose and result areas? What kind of result-based financing approach could be employed to sustainably improve quality of care in urban and peri-urban primary health care units and referral facilities? What approaches could best support private health facilities to define and sustain quality of care (QOC) interventions for improved RMNCAH services and outcomes? What approaches could best support rebuilding the health infrastructure and/or restoring health service delivery in conflict-affected areas? What new approaches and interventions could be tested to improve the community-facility, inter-facility and intra-facility referral linkages in PHCUs and referral hospitals? What new approaches and interventions could be tested for improving quality of care across the life cycle (pre-pregnancy-delivery-childhood-adolescence)? What approaches or platforms could best support effective community engagement in QOC improvement efforts? Is the tiered approach logical in sequence to achieve the stated results? What evidence could be required to ensure the tailor-made approaches will be effective in accurately categorizing the health facilities into the different tiers? What approaches could best address the quality of care gaps in urban settings? In general, what other critical intervention or approach are missing in the draft concept note? IV. SUBMISSION PROCESS Comments must be submitted by email to the following email addresses: caddis@usaid.gov with a copy to Yordanos Abraham, yabraham@usaid.gov no later than 17:00 Addis Ababa time by the Response Due Date shown on the cover page of this RFI.

Program Objectives: ASSH program is a grassroots grant assistance program that provides grants for small community development activities that improve living conditions. The program is intended to be flexible and allow the Ambassador to respond directly to requests from local communities for assistance with projects that have immediate impact, and further Mission priorities. Equally important, the Special Self-Help program is structured to encourage communities to be self-reliant and undertake similar activities on their own in the future. Projects must be locally initiated, must have strong community involvement, must significantly benefit to a large number of people and will be self-sustaining. Furthermore, projects must have community participation and contribution of 10% or more of the total cost of the project. Community contribution may be cash or in kind, such as volunteer time and labor, donated land, equipment and materials. The U.S. contribution will be a one-time basis only. Acceptable project objectives include, but are not limited to, the following: &#8226;Economic diversification, including small business creation and income generation &#183; Generate sustainable income and employment opportunities in local communities benefiting the larger community beyond individual group members; &#183; Advance economic diversification at the grassroots level and promote a culture of entrepreneurship; &#183; Encourage use of local natural resources for income generation through agricultural projects; &#183; Purchase of income generating-equipment such as weaving looms, threshing machines, oil presses, beehives etc. &#8226;Social services &#183; Improve the lives of populations which may be disadvantaged or at-risk on a temporary or chronic basis, including people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, the elderly and female heads of household; &#183; Construction and/or furnishing of community-initiated health clinics; &#183; Water and sanitation related projects. &#8226;Youth and child development &#183; Create opportunities for youth, including employment; &#183; Construction of school rooms or community centers; &#183; Purchase of school equipment and furnishings. &#8226;Community-based natural resource management &#183; Expand effective community ownership and management of natural resources; &#183; Developing sustainable community-based tourism; &#183; Promoting the conservation of natural resources. Ambassador&#8217;s Self-Help Program funds may be used to fund construction projects. These projects should be small in scale (under 10,000 sq ft) and provide a public benefit. The following forms should be included in the application when proposing construction projects: SF-424C (Budget for construction programs), SF-424D (Assurances for construction programs), and SF-271 (Outlay Report and Request for construction programs). These forms can be found on www.grants.gov. Great care should be taken when preparing budgets for construction projects as prices of materials often increase from the time when proposal is submitted until a project selected for funding is implemented to avoid failure due to running out of funds. The following is not eligible for funding: &#183; Projects relating to partisan political activity, including fund raising campaigns; &#183; Purchase and set up of surveillance equipment; &#183; Creating, continuing, or supplementing technical assistance programs; &#183; Duplication of other U.S. Government programs; &#183; Projects that would benefit, either personally or politically, to any employee (e.g. direct hire, contractor, part-time) of the U.S. Government, or the spouse or family member of a U.S. Government employee; &#183; Charitable or donation related activities; &#183; Projects that support specific religious or military activities, as well as those relating to police, prisons, or other law enforcement. &#183; Scientific research; &#183; Projects intended primarily for the growth or institutional development of the organization; &#183; Purchase of alcohol, medicine, school uniforms, school fees, bursaries, or personal expenses; &#183; Support for educational or other facilities used to a significant degree by U.S. employees or their dependents; &#183; Support for abortion-related facilities and services; &#183; Purchase or production of toxic or otherwise unsafe products such as pesticides or hazardous chemicals; &#183; Salaries for implementing organization staff or contractors &#183; Purchase of food, refreshments, food parcels; medicines and other consumables &#183; Support for private businesses, private cr&#232;ches, or public/government schools unless through involvement of a Parent-Teacher Association. &#183; Training costs &#183; Travel costs &#183; &#8220;Start up&#8221; or &#8220;Seed&#8221; capital or loans &#183; Other activities barred by the Foreign Assistance Act, or the program Participants and Audiences: The Ambassador&#8217;s Special Self-Help Program will only accept proposals from not-for-profit organizations registered on the federal or state level in Nigeria.

These analyses will provide an understanding avian population abundance, trends, and avian response to management/restoration actions in the surrounding ecosystems. The findings will allow adaptive management strategies to benefit avian species who use the UMRs diverse habitats throughout their lifecycle. Objective 3: Create reports and toolkits that summarize the management recommendations based on monitoring survey data. These will inform Corps, partners, stakeholders and landowners alike can utilize for floodplain habitat management. These reports/toolkits will also be used outline future research needs when eliciting additional partnerships. The focus area consists of USACE lands in navigation Pool 27, 26, 25 and 24 and the lower portion of the Illinois River. The Mississippi river miles that the areas border are 183 to 298.

The grant competition supports both new and experienced human rights organizations in their efforts to protect human rights, fundamental freedoms and monitor and report on potential human rights violations. We strongly encourage proposals focused on the following vulnerable or marginalized groups: women&#8217;s rights, the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people, the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), the rights of those in the activists&#8217; community, especially those working on issues related to corruption, environmental protection, or journalism. The project activities must fall into the following areas to be considered for funding in this thematic competition: &#183; Conducting education or awareness campaigns on the rights of vulnerable or marginalized groups, including &#8220;know your rights&#8221; campaigns to empower at-risk individuals and stigma reduction campaigns to create a more tolerant society. Organizing training sessions for journalists on human rights to improve reporting in the media and increase media coverage. &#183; Monitoring and reporting on possible violations of the rights of vulnerable or marginalized groups in Ukraine or in the region where the organization is located. &#183; Promoting the rule of law, tolerance and inclusion of marginalized groups in Ukraine, reducing manifestations of xenophobia, disrespect and hate; fighting against hate crimes. &#183; Ensuring equal access to the justice system for vulnerable or marginalized groups, including projects supporting legal advocacy, (client counseling and representation, primary and secondary legal aid) and strategic litigation against discrimination and other issues to influence broader legal practice in Ukraine. &#183; Training police officers, investigators, and prosecutors about legal aspects and proper investigation of the hate and politically motivated crimes. Create an enabling, and inclusive, environment where human rights defenders can advocate for human rights and democratic governance. Protecting and supporting human rights defenders. To increase the capacity of civil society to defend itself and mitigate the impacts of cyber of physical attacks. Strengthen institutional frameworks for the promotion of human rights, human rights defenders&#8217; protection systems, rule of law, and communications and collaboration between Ukrainian government and civil society. Raise awareness of violence against environmental defenders and encourages wide engagement with the stakeholders domestically as well in multilateral institutions. To increase access to information, opportunities for public participation, and access to justice in environmental matters as well as initiatives that build Ukraine&#8217;s capacity to protect its own environmental defenders. Combat the violence and abuse, criminalization, discrimination, and stigma targeting LGBTQI+ persons abroad and work to support the human rights defenders on the ground. Eliminate information and physical attacks on representatives of the gender equality movement in Ukraine, provide assistance to victims, highlight those cases in media. Other innovative ways address these issues will also be considered. PAS strongly encourages proposals to include new and effective communication tools and demonstrate a clear target audience. Due to COVID-19, direct personal contact between project implementers and beneficiaries should be limited. Applicants should use online tools for training and meeting with beneficiaries; and visual tools such as billboards, posters, announcements with QR codes, video advertisements (print materials are discouraged). Proposals must identify the project&#8217;s target audience; concrete and achievable goals and plans to measure progress against these goals; a realistic action plan; and a reasonable cost estimate. PAS strongly supports cooperation between different stakeholders and will give preference to projects that engage state and private institutions to implement the project and ensure its sustainability. Ten percent of grant funds may be allocated for administrative needs of the organization during the period of project implementation.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade announces an open competition for organizations to submit applications for the BOLD Academic Fellowship Program. The BOLD (Balkanski omladinski lideri, Young Balkan Leaders in English) network is a project of PDS that seeks to develop the leadership capacity of young Serbians by empowering them to implement projects for positive change in their communities in two thematic areas: civic engagement and economic development. Anyone age 18-35 in Serbia can join the BOLD network where members have access to three main types of competitive opportunities: 1. BOLD Academic Fellowships: Two in-depth leadership training experiences in the United States for 5-6 weeks, one on each BOLD theme. 2. BOLD Workshops: Two workshops, one week to 10 days long, on leadership and project management, each on one of the BOLD themes. 3. BOLD Small Grant Competition: An annual competition, open to all BOLD members, for funds up to $15,000 to implement projects in the areas of the BOLD themes over the course of a year. Priority Region: Serbia. PDS Belgrade strongly urges potential applicants to consider recruiting participants for these workshops from cities and towns in Serbia outside of Belgrade. Program Objectives: The BOLD Academic Fellowship Program consists of two fellowships to take place in the United States for 5-6 weeks each, one on the theme of civic engagement and one on the theme of economic development. Applicants may propose implementation of either one of the fellowships, OR implementation of two fellowships. If the proposal is for one fellowship, please indicate in box &#8220;c&#8221; of the application form if the theme will be civic engagement or economic development. Each fellowship should be both academic and practical in nature, approximately 5-6 weeks in length, and ideally include a residency at a U.S. academic institution with a significant component of experiential learning, including community service, in the community or in another location. Ideally, each institute should also incorporate a homestay experience as part of the program. The primary outcome desired by PDS is for fellows, either individually or in groups, upon their return to Serbia, to design a civic or economic project to be implemented in their communities over the course of the year. By the end of the fellowship, they should have a complete draft of a project proposal or business plan, which will be competitive for funding from the Embassy or other donors. The academic component in the United States should include group discussions, experiential learning activities, and exercises that focus on the best practices, leading research, and most influential ideas and models pertaining to the theme of the fellowship. The experiential learning component should include substantive and participatory community activities related to the theme of the fellowship. Where possible, a particular focus on the impact of not-for-profit organizations and/or social enterprises should be integrated into the program. Both components of each fellowship should teach leadership skills and provide the necessary knowledge and experience for students to implement their follow-on projects in Serbia, including, but not limited to teambuilding, collective problem-solving, effective communication, appreciation of diversity, and management skills. In accordance with the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Underserved Communities, proposals should demonstrate how the program advances equity with respect to race, ethnicity, religion, income, geography, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability. The proposal should also demonstrate how the program will further engagement in underserved communities and with individuals from underserved communities. Proposals should demonstrate how addressing racial equity and underserved communities will enhance the program&#8217;s goals and objectives, as well as the experience of participants. In light of social distancing measures, and to limit the spread of COVID-19, we welcome proposals that utilize video conferencing, distance learning tools, etc. If your proposal includes in-person activities, please consider the inclusion of contingency plans, just in case the health situation requires that social distancing measures be implemented during the grant period. How might you switch your project from an in-person to a virtual format? If you are successful in securing PDS funding to launch your project, you will be expected to publicize your activities, including through social media and/or traditional press outlets; and highlight U.S. Embassy support for your activity, with our logo included on project-related materials. Participants and Audiences: Participants or primary audiences for BOLD Academic Fellowships should be Serbian undergraduate students, age 18-25, from across Serbia. Each fellowship should consist of at least 10 participants traveling to the United States. Information Session.

In support of our shared interests with our partners, the United States provides funding to recipients through grants. Grants are official legal instruments of the United States government that come with many different requirements for both the government and the recipient. Individuals and organizations interested in partnering with the embassy can find information about opportunities on the embassy&#8217;s website or on www.grants.gov. The funding announcement contains all the information you need to submit a competitive application. Implementing a grant, also referred to as an award, can be a challenge for foreign organizations. This document is intended to assist you in better understanding the process at the beginning so that your next project can get off to a good start. The embassy divides the award process into four phases, pre-award, award, post-award, and closeout, to help manage the requirements and activities. The following information is organized by the same phases, as an overview of the requirements and activities for recipients. Pre-award phase An announcement of funding can be presented as a Notice of Funding Opportunity, Annual Program Statement, or Statement of Interest and provides: A description of the proposed project Anticipated amount of funding for each award All administrative requirements for the application, submission instructions, and contact information. Contact information for any questions. In addition to preparing an application, potential grant recipients may also be required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) by obtaining a Unique Entity Identifier number and NCAGE code. Each of these registrations is completed online and is free of charge. The Unique Entity Identifier is located below the DUNS Number on the entity registration record. After April 4, 2022, entities registering in SAM.gov will no longer have to go to Dun &amp; Bradstreet and acquire a DUNS number. The purpose of the registrations is to establish an organization&#8217;s identify in preparation for receiving funds from the U.S. government. Applicants who are applying as individuals, not on behalf of organizations, do not need to complete these registrations. The registration process takes time, so starting the process early is recommended. Please note: in order to be successful, please pay attention to the following recommendations: Read the solicitation very carefully and make sure you understand all requirements. Submit the application on time and in the required format. Describe the proposed program activities clearly and logically so it can easily be understood. Make the budgets realistic and don&#8217;t include costs that are unreasonable or unnecessary. Once the embassy reviews all submitted applications, it may contact applicants to clarify some information, or perhaps to make some modifications to the original proposal. Applicants should be responsive to these requests to remain competitive. If the embassy receives more than one application under an announcement, the embassy will select the best proposal according to selection criteria published in the original announcement. At this point the applicant may be contacted to provide additional documentation (financial records, for example) before a grant is issued. Award Phase When the grant is issued, the recipient will become familiar with officials responsible for the grant at the embassy: The Grants Officer is responsible for all legal actions for the award, and is the only person who can sign the grant document, approve payments, and make changes to the award. A Grants Officer Representative (GOR) may also be assigned to the award. The GOR has different responsibilities, including monitoring the award progress and reviewing reports and other information from the grant recipient. The GOR will also act as the primary contact for the recipient. A Financial Management Officer is responsible for processing payments. There are several different types of awards and each works somewhat differently. A grant provides funding for the recipient to conduct the project. A cooperative agreement includes more embassy involvement in programmatic activities. A fixed amount award is negotiated entirely up front with an unchanging cost and does not require financial reporting. Awards are also made to individuals instead of organizations. The award documents will indicate what type of award has been issued. Recipients should discuss any questions about award requirements before starting the award activities. There are several key points to keep in mind before starting on the project: Recipients should not begin to spend money on the project until they have received the official written award documents Take time to understand everything in the award document and in the Terms and Conditions (https://www.state.gov/about-us-office-of-the-procurement-executive/). Ask your embassy colleagues any questions if something is not clear. The award document will include the GO and GOR contact information. Know the amount of funding, the start and end dates, official budget (if required), expected activities, types of required reporting and due dates. Post award phase The recipient conducts all award activities during the post-award phase. Additionally, the recipient is responsible for requesting funding payments, submitting the reports detailed in the award documents, tracking award expenditures, and monitoring the progress of the award activities. The recipient also needs to understand what award changes can be determined independently and what the GO must approve in advance. For example, a recipient cannot hire a new staff member to be in charge of program activities without obtaining GO approval first. A recipient cannot change certain activities or alter the overall direction of the award without obtaining approval. If there are any questions about what changes require prior approval, check with the GO or GOR. The recipient is also responsible for notifying the GO or GOR if there are any concerns or problems, such as an inability to meet reporting deadlines or perform proposed activities. The Grants Officer can work with a recipient to find solutions, such as extending the award to allow additional time to complete the award activities. A grant is an important agreement that includes rules and responsibilities. A project cannot be completely successful if the rules of the grant are not followed closely. This should always be done in close partnership with the embassy, with both the recipient and embassy in close communication, aware of upcoming dates and events, and working together openly and transparently for the overall benefit of the program. Finally, remember that the embassy has a responsibility for making sure the award is progressing effectively and that the recipient organization is being a responsible partner. To this end, the embassy may ask for additional information or even schedule a site visit to examine financial systems or observe program activities. Closeout Phase This final phase of the award begins when the performance period ends. Once the performance period ends, the recipient should not continue any grant-funded activities or spend any new funds. The recipient is required to submit all final reports for the grant within 90 days of this date Recipients should refer to their award documents to confirm the types of reports they are required to submit for closeout. This is also a time for the embassy and recipients to review the award activities to determine what worked well and what might be changed on future projects.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade announces an open competition for organizations to submit applications for the BOLD Workshop Program. The BOLD (Balkanski omladinski lideri, Young Balkan Leaders in English) network is a project of PDS that seeks to develop the leadership capacity of young Serbians by empowering them to implement projects for positive change in their communities in two thematic areas: civic engagement and economic development. Anyone age 18-35 in Serbia can join the BOLD network where members have access to three main types of competitive opportunities: 1. BOLD Academic Fellowships: Two in-depth leadership training experiences in the United States for 5-6 weeks, one on each BOLD theme. 2. BOLD Workshops: Two workshops, one week to 10 days long, on leadership and project management, each on one of the BOLD themes. 3. BOLD Small Grant Competition: An annual competition, open to all BOLD members, for funds up to $15,000 to implement projects in the areas of the BOLD themes over the course of a year. Priority Region: Serbia. PDS Belgrade strongly urges potential applicants to consider recruiting participants for these workshops from cities and towns in Serbia outside of Belgrade. Program Objectives: The BOLD Action Workshop Program consists of two workshops to take place in Serbia for one week to 10 days each, one on the theme of civic engagement and one on the theme of economic development. Workshops should be scheduled in accordance with school/academic calendars. Applicants may propose implementation of either one of the workshops, OR implementation of two workshops. If the proposal is for one workshop, please indicate in box &#8220;c&#8221; of the application form if the theme will be civic engagement or economic development. The proposal should contain a detailed day-by-day schedule for each workshop, and other necessary information that makes it clear to anyone not familiar with it how the program will meet the stated objectives and projected outcomes. The primary outcome desired by PDS is for workshop participants, either individually or in groups, to design a civic or economic project to be implemented in their communities over the course of the following year. By the end of the workshop, participants should complete a basic draft of their project designs in the form of a project proposal or business plan, which will be competitive for funding from the Embassy or other donors. Participants will be eligible to submit their proposals in a BOLD small grant competition that will take place later in the year. To prepare them for this, a representative from the PDS grants team should be invited to present during the workshop on the basics of applying for a grant with the U.S. Embassy. In accordance with the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Underserved Communities, proposals should demonstrate how the program advances equity with respect to race, ethnicity, religion, income, geography, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability. The proposal should also demonstrate how the program will further engagement in underserved communities and with individuals from underserved communities. Proposals should demonstrate how addressing racial equity and underserved communities will enhance the program&#8217;s goals and objectives, as well as the experience of participants. In light of social distancing measures, and to limit the spread of COVID-19, we welcome proposals that utilize video conferencing, distance learning tools, etc. If your proposal includes in-person activities, please consider the inclusion of contingency plans, just in case the health situation requires that social distancing measures be implemented during the grant period. How might you switch your project from an in-person to a virtual format? It is the obligation of the applicant to ensure that workshop participants&#8217; information about themselves, their experience in the workshop, and/or their project ideas are shared and publicized on social media platforms of the BOLD network so that others can see their leadership examples and be motivated by their experience in the workshop. Participants and Audiences: Each workshop should be designed for at least 40 participants, who will be derived from the membership of the new BOLD Network as well as from the recruiting efforts of the applicant. Each workshop should be composed of at least 25 participants from across Serbia, 10 from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and 5 from Montenegro. Priority should be given to qualified applicants from outside the capital city in each country. The age range of BOLD members is 18-35, but the applicant may limit the age range of participants in either workshop, to best fit the proposed workshop&#8217;s theme and objectives. Each participant should only attend one workshop. The applicant should propose a regionwide recruitment plan to reach workshop participants from all parts of the three countries that goes beyond a public call for applications to include targeted outreach to appropriate youth audiences. PDS will coordinate with Embassies in BiH and Montenegro to assist with recruitment through BOLD networks there. The applicant should select and vet workshop participants and present the final list of participants for each workshop to PDS for review before they are notified of their selection. Information Session. PDS will hold a virtual information session on February 23, 2022, at 16:00 (4 pm) Central European time to discuss this funding opportunity and to answer questions from potential applicants. Please contact PDS at BOLDSerbia@state.gov for details.

Recent data show that nearly 1 in 7 pregnant people report current drinking and about 1 in 20 report binge drinking in the past 30 days. Further, current alcohol use and binge drinking during pregnancy in the US increased slightly from 2011 to 2018. Data also show that polysubstance use is high among those who use alcohol during pregnancy. While few estimates for the full range of FASDs are available, experts estimate that up to 1 in 20 US school children may have FASDs. CDC proposes to allocate funds to implement Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) DD22-2201, Addressing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders through National Partnerships. The project period will be four years, with 4 12-month budget periods and an anticipated project start date of September 30, 2022. The purpose of this NOFO is to promote the prevention of FASDs and the early identification and management of infants and children with FASDs through a collaborative framework of national partner organizations. Strategic areas of focus may include training clinical, public health, or community-based organizations serving populations of reproductive age, including pregnant people, as well as those serving children and families about prenatal alcohol and other substance use, screening and brief intervention for alcohol and other substances, and identification and management of children living with FASDs; developing and disseminating evidence-based recommendations and messaging nationally, regionally, and through health systems and other networks to prevent or reduce alcohol and other substance use among people who are pregnant or might be pregnant as well as to promote early identification and management of children living with FASDs; developing and fostering or participating in a champions network to galvanize support for and share messaging and resources about prevention of FASDs and early identification and management of children living with FASDs; building community, state, and local capacity to link clinical and public health partners to reach affected populations with effective programs and practices; coordinating efforts across projects to ensure consistent information and resources are being used; and evaluating the effectiveness of program strategies.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Eligibility Requirements Applicants for the Alaska Native-Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions Education Competitive Grants Program (ANNH) must meet all the requirements discussed in this RFA. Failure to meet the eligibility criteria by the application deadline may result in exclusion from consideration or, preclude NIFA from making an award. For those new to Federal financial assistance, NIFA&#8217;s Grants Overview provides highly recommended information about grants and other resources to help understand the Federal awards process. For the purpose of the ANNH Grants Program, an eligible institution means an individual public or private, nonprofit Alaska Native-Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions of higher education that meet the definitions of Alaska-Serving Institutions or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution established in Title III, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1059d). Table 3: ANNH Eligible Applicants Branch Institutions of a State System For the purpose of this program, the individual branches of a state university system or public system of higher education that are separately accredited as degree granting institutions are treated as separate, individual institutions, eligible to apply for and receive awards, provided that they otherwise satisfy the definition of Alaska Native-Serving Institution or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution as specified above. Independent Branch Campuses Independent branch campuses of individual institutions may apply for and receive grant awards under this program, provided that they otherwise satisfy the definition of Alaska Native-Serving Institution or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution as specified above. An &#8220;independent branch campus&#8221; means a unit of a 2-year or 4-year institution of higher education that is geographically apart from the main campus, is permanent in nature, offers courses for credit and programs leading to an associate or bachelor&#8217;s degree, and is autonomous to the extent that it has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory organization and its own budgetary and hiring authority. Collaborative Arrangements Two or more eligible, individual institutions, independent branch campuses, or branch institutions of a state system may form a collaboration to carry out education, applied research, and extension programs in the food and agricultural sciences. In addition to the individual eligible institutions (or independent branch campuses, etc.), such a collaboration also may include units of State government and private sector entities.

This grant provides funding for 28 news productions (written, audio/video, and/or visual) that utilize Liberian investigative reporters and report on contextual issues relevant to the commitments made by the Government of Liberia during the 2021 Summit for Democracy, including: &#183; Amending the Anti-Corruption Act to strengthen prosecutorial powers &#183; Establishing a dedicated criminal court for the prosecution and convictions of public officials, individuals, or institutions engaged in corrupt practices and financial offenses &#183; Continuing efforts to reduce and ultimately end gender-based violence &#183; Engaging with traditional leaders &#8220;to end all forms of harmful traditional practices&#8221; &#183; Proposing an anti-female genital mutilation bill &#183; Committing to fairness, transparency, and accountability in election funding &#183; Prioritizing the participation of more women in the electoral process and in key positions in the government &#183; Making all legislative votes public with individual legislators&#8217; votes tracked &#183; Formalizing customary land tenure The NGO grantee must provide support to the reporters in reporting, editing, and logistics associated with each production, including issues that may arise after publishing, with the overall objective of media practitioner development. The productions must be published in local media houses for a general Liberian audience. The support staff must include U.S. citizen experts in the production process. The U.S. Embassy will only provide funding to the implementing partner&#8217;s support for investigative journalists and will enact no editorial oversight of production topics, production process, or of the final product. Applicants should describe their experience supporting reporters in Liberia or in similar media environments, the type of journalism expertise they are able to provide, how they will select the reporters or media institutions with which they will work, and, in general, how they will support their local partners. In addition, applicants should describe their publication plan for the resulting productions. Please carefully follow all the instructions in your application as spelled out below. The program supports the Embassy&#8217;s strategic goal of supporting democratic resiliency in Liberia in the lead up to the December 2022 Summit for Democracy. Both the United States and Liberia committed to an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal and to tackle the greatest threats faced by democracies today through collective action. The program also supports the professionalization of local media. Ideal applicants are media-focused NGOs with experience working in Liberia, including already established networks. Program Objectives The program implementer will independently liaise with and support local reporters, determine the content and format of productions, distribute the productions to local media, and track local reach and reaction to each production. The objectives of the program will include: 1) Demonstrate to the Liberian public the importance of a free press to democratic resiliency 2) Develop the capacity of the Liberian media for objective reporting and fact-checking 3) Encourage the Government of Liberia during the &#8220;year of action&#8221; to realize its commitments made at the 2021 Summit for Democracy 4) Communicate the U.S. Government&#8217;s commitment to good governance and democratic values</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Researchers are expected to synthesize the North American fire scar network and combine it with modern fire records to create a multi-century record of fire across North America. Recent advances in paleoclimate methods and the continental-scale network of tree-ring chronologies are expected to be used to reconstruct seasonal climate variables tailored to better understand variability in climate drivers of fire. Specific approaches are expected to include: 1) multi-century spatio-temporal dynamics of fire-climate relationships across North America; 2) climate drivers of changing synchrony of wildfire (e.g., widespread fire years); 3) cyclical properties of fire occurrence that can provide predictive capacity, including relationships with ocean-atmosphere oscillations (e.g., El Nino/Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation); and 4) combining historical and modern fire-climate relationships to project future wildfire potential at regional to continental scales. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

MSIs, HBCUs, HSIs, HACU, AANAPISIs and their auxiliary entities are encouraged to apply. Additionally, religious organizations are encouraged to apply. Such organizations are not required to alter their religious character to participate in a government program, nor to cease engaging in explicitly religious activities outside the program, nor effectively to relinquish their Federal statutory protections for religious hiring decisions. Likewise, other organizations meeting the WBC program eligibility criteria, as well as other organizations serving socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs, are also encouraged to apply. Proposals responding to this FOA must be posted to www.Grants.gov by no later than11:59:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, on March 14, 2022. No other methods of submission are permitted. Proposals submitted after the stipulated deadline will be rejected without evaluation. Unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate through documentation obtained from Grants.gov that they attempted to submit their proposal in a timely manner but were unable to do so solely due to Grants.gov system issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>4</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The project consists of two parts: 1) an assessment of key threats to desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) from reduced water sources and increased visitation in Joshua Tree National Park, and 2) radionuclide levels, movements, and spatial use of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) on the Nevada National Security Site. Goals are: 1) to assess whether increasing levels of visitor use on recreational trails and at water sources are causing changes in bighorn sheep habitat use and whether these responses have the potential to negatively impact the population; and 2) to understand radionuclide levels in mule deer and pronghorn antelope that use the Nevada National Security Site (formerly, the Nevada Test Site), their habitat use, the range of movement of these animals, and the potential dose to hunters consuming them. This research will contribute to the adaptive management of large ungulates in arid environments where anthropogenic activities have the potential to negatively affect wildlife and indirectly, to impact human health and safety. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

The solicitation is available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at https://nspires.nasaprs.com/ , selecting &quot;Solicitations,&quot; then selecting &quot;Open,&quot; and, finally, entering &quot;Early Career Faculty (ECF)&#8221; in the Keyword search. The Space Technology Research Grants (STRG) Program within STMD seeks proposals from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. Our Nation&#8217;s universities couple fundamental research with education, encouraging a culture of innovation based on the discovery of knowledge. Universities are, therefore, ideally positioned to both conduct fundamental space technology research and diffuse newly found knowledge into society at large through graduate students and industry, government, and other partnerships. STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. universities promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country&apos;s scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. These investments also create, fortify, and nurture the talent base of highly skilled engineers, scientists, and technologists to improve America&#8217;s technological and economic competitiveness. The following topics are anticipated for the final appendix: Topic 1 &#8211; Development of Lightweight Solar Sail Attitude Control Technologies Topic 2 &#8211; Hibernation and Recovery of Solar-Powered Systems for Lunar Missions Topic 3 &#8211; Tailorable Composite Design Concepts towards Dimensionally Stable Structures Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. The PI must be an untenured Assistant Professor on the tenure track at the sponsoring U.S. university at the time of award. The PI must be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status of permanent residency. The PI must be the primary researcher on the effort; Co-Investigators are not permitted. Collaborators (other than NASA civil servants/JPL) are permitted. See the solicitation (Section 3.0) for complete requirements regarding eligibility and for definitions and restrictions regarding collaborators. A PI may submit only one proposal in response to this appendix. NASA encourages submission of ECF proposals on behalf of early career faculty members at all U.S. universities and especially encourages proposals submitted on behalf of women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities. The financial and programmatic support for ECF comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate. Awards are planned to start in early October 2022. NASA plans to make approximately 6 awards as a result of this ECF solicitation, subject to the receipt of meritorious proposals and the availability of funds. The actual number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received; NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this solicitation. All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES or through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov) by an authorized organizational representative. Notices of Intent are strongly encouraged by March 2, 2022. Proposals are due on or before March 31, 2022. Detailed submission instructions are provided in the solicitation. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) documents located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>formatting update in description</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

State AIS Plans have been transmitted by state governors and then approved by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force. All state grants will be awarded based on a competitive process for which only Great Lakes states or their designee are eligible. Funding is provided to support implementation of State AIS Plans which helps states in preventing introduction and spread of AIS on state and surrounding lands. State environmental agencies develop the science-based plans and approaches to make sound decisions to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS and adapt to changes in state waters over time. Proposed work must either be within the Great Lakes Basin or near enough to the basin that it contributes substantially to the prevention and/or control of AIS in the Great Lakes basin. Activities such as outreach, boat ramp inspections, and/or law enforcement are often done outside the basin but make substantial contributions when work is done in areas where people are likely to transit (and thereby potentially transfer AIS) into the Great Lakes basin. Early detection, rapid response, and/or control efforts outside the basin must address: &#8226; Species with a substantial potential for interbasin transfer (e.g., hydrilla in a waterbody near the Great Lakes basin that receives heavy boat use). &#8226; Species of significant concern to the Great Lakes community within a Great Lakes state. &#8226; Activities where the primary motivation is the prevent transfer of AIS into the Great Lakes basin. In the end, we are pursuing and funding whatever actions have the greatest benefit to the Great Lakes Basin. INVASIVE CARP WORK IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION IF IT HAS BEEN INITIALLY SUBMITTED AND VETTED THROUGH THE ANNUAL DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE INVASIVE CARP REGIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE&apos;S (ICRCC) INVASIVE CARP ACTION PLAN. Invasive carp work funded and implemented through the Action Plan is coordinated through the ICRCC. The ICRCC develops an annual work plan that is largely supported through a separate source of GLRI funding and which undergoes a separate review process that includes Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and approval.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Recipients will spread and scale the placement of ECD experts in pediatric settings that serve the focus population within a state, territory, jurisdiction, or tribal area. To achieve long-term improvements in early developmental health, school readiness, family well-being, and health equity, the primary goals are to: 1) improve equitable access to a continuum of ECD services in pediatric primary care practices, and 2) improve the capacity of pediatric practices and workforce to deliver high-quality ECD services that address the holistic needs of children and families.

The mission of GTO is to research, develop, and validate innovative and cost-competitive technologies and tools to locate, access, and develop geothermal resources in the United States, enabling the deployment of carbon-free, flexible geothermal energy in both the electric and non-electric sectors. Geothermal energy is a renewable and diverse energy solution for the United States, providing reliable and flexible electricity generation and delivering unique technology solutions to America&#8217;s heating and cooling demands. Geothermal resources can be found nationwide, are &#8220;always on,&#8221; and represent vast domestic energy potential. Only a fraction of this potential has been realized due to technical and non-technical barriers that constrain industry growth. The U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Geothermal Technologies Office&#8217;s GeoVision report concluded that with technology improvements, especially in areas relevant to drilling costs reduction, geothermal power generation could increase 26-fold from today, representing 60 gigawatts-electric (GWe) by 2050. Building a clean and equitable energy economy and addressing the climate crisis is a top priority of the Biden Administration. This FOA will advance the Biden Administration&#8217;s goals (1) to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and (2) to &#8220;deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050&#8220;1 to the benefit of all Americans. The Department of Energy is committed to pushing the frontiers of science and engineering, catalyzing clean energy jobs through research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&amp;D), and ensuring environmental justice and inclusion of underserved communities. This FOA targets technology developments that will provide significant improvements in drilling performance in commercial geothermal settings. The GeoVision Roadmap2 outlines a compilation of technical, economic, and institutional actions that the entire geothermal community, including DOE, industry, and academia must address in order for geothermal technologies to play a larger role in the nation&#8217;s energy mix. A key &#8220;Action Area&#8221; identified in the GeoVision Roadmap and strategic goals for the Hydrothermal Resource Program are highlighted below. GeoVision Key Action 1.3 - Improve geothermal drilling and wellbore integrity: Integrating improved drilling and well-completion technology, better well design and construction materials, improved decision making, and innovative drilling financing can help industry realize better drilling efficiencies and effectiveness. DELIVERABLE(S): New designs and approaches that enhance drilling efficiency and reduce well costs. IMPACT(S): Reduced costs and risks and improved reliability. GTO Hydrothermal Resource Program Strategic Goals: &#191; Expand geothermal energy opportunities throughout United States. &#191; Support research on drilling technologies that increase efficiency, lower costs, and lower risk related to hydrothermal reservoir development. &#191; Accelerate oil &amp; gas technology transfer to address geothermal&#8217;s toughest challenges. The construction of geothermal wells can represent up to 50% of total capital costs for geothermal energy production. Technologies and techniques that can reduce the time needed or the material costs associated with the construction of geothermal wells are key to achieving cost reductions. Furthermore, recent advancements in drill bits, casing, and drilling workflows have achieved significant cost reductions and improvements in wellbore quality in geothermal subsurface settings. Such significant reductions in time and capital requirements, when achieved in a reproducible manner, would represent material progress towards achieving the goals of the GeoVision study. GTO seeks to reduce the financial risk of technologies and techniques not widely deployed in geothermal resource development. Of particular interest are projects focused on advancing geothermal well construction through the development, modification, and/or adaption of technologies and/or techniques that reduce drilling costs in a real-world geothermal field setting. FOA Goal: The ultimate goal of this FOA is a reduction in geothermal well costs. Because drilling costs are highly variable and sensitive to one-off events, average daily drilling penetration rate (e.g. average m/day) is the basis of performance measurement selected in this FOA. This FOA seeks to affect a 25% improvement in geothermal drilling rates by supporting multiple demonstration projects that each target this level of improvement. This metric and performance target will allow for quantitative evaluation of project impacts to support broad deployment of the most successful approaches. To apply to this FOA, Applicants must register with and submit application materials through EERE Exchange (https://eere-exchange.energy.gov), EERE&#8217;s online application portal. The Exchange system enforces hard deadlines for Letter of Intent and Full Application submissions. The APPLY and SUBMIT buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. The intention of this design is to consistently enforce a standard deadline for all applicants. Applicants that experience issues with submissions PRIOR to the FOA Deadline should contact the Exchange Helpdesk for assistance at EERE-ExchangeSupport@hq.doe.gov. Applicants are responsible for meeting each submission deadline. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit their Letters of Intent and Full Applications at least 48 hours in advance of the submission deadlines.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The U.S. Embassy Kyiv / EUR Bureau of the U.S. Department of State announces an open grants competition under the theme of unity in Ukraine to foster mutual understanding and relationships among religious, ethnic, and linguistic groups in all regions of Ukraine. Grant projects will foster communication and sharing of information, experience and expertise among communities as well as the identification and implementation of joint projects and activities. Please follow all instructions below. Priority Region: Ukraine Program Objectives: Selected projects will work to promote a united Ukraine, inter-regional exchange of experience, consolidated project planning, and greater awareness of different regional, linguistic, and religious issues across various regions of Ukraine. The project implementers will encourage discussions at the regional and national levels on these topics to foster Ukrainian national unity. To achieve long-term and sustainable results for this initiative, partnerships are encouraged. Organizations should have a clear plan for a united Ukraine. Examples of successful proposals include, but are not limited to the following components: &#183; Creating and reinforcing cooperation and networking between students to address social, political, environmental, health, and economic issues, which include inter-regional students&#8217; exchange, student partnership. &#183; Inter-faith cooperation to address social issues and promote positive change in communities &#183; Foster cooperation, promote volunteerism, and empower and protect the rights of minorities, such as women, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, etc. throughout Ukraine. &#183; Using interactive discussions, debates, public hearings, seminars and conferences as a tool to reach out to target audiences for promoting access to information on the topics of a national and inter-regional value. Innovative methodology and tools are encouraged. &#183; Creating effective and sustainable inter-regional partnerships between NGOs, media, and local communities to work on cooperative inter-regional projects on such topics as diversity and inclusion, religious freedoms, rights of vulnerable groups, exploring traditions of ethnic groups residing in communities, diminishing stereotypes about ethnic, racial, religious and other groups, and combatting disinformation and segregation. &#183; Organizing video conferences and webinars on current regional and national issues with partners in other regions of Ukraine. Other innovative ways to address these issues will also be considered. PAS strongly encourages proposals to include new and effective communication tools and demonstrate a clear target audience. Due to COVID-19, direct personal contact between project implementers and beneficiaries should be limited. Applicants should use online tools for training and meeting with beneficiaries; and visual tools such as billboards, posters, announcements with QR codes, video advertisements (print materials are discouraged). Proposals must identify the project&#8217;s target audience; concrete and achievable goals and plans to measure progress against these goals; a realistic action plan; and a reasonable cost estimate. PAS strongly supports cooperation between different stakeholders and will give preference to projects that engage state and private institutions to implement the project and ensure its sustainability.

Program Objectives: 1. Strengthening public understanding of freedom of speech and press freedom: The objective is to improve and promote adherence to international best practice in implementing fundamental freedom of speech and press freedom. The PD Section will support new or existing initiatives to invigorate local communities with ideas, information, questions, and discourse around freedom of speech and journalism. Proposals may center on events, panel discussions, campaigns, outreach efforts, educational initiatives, workshops, media outlet partnerships, and other formats that can be effective in building local understanding of these core freedoms. Priority will be given to proposals that integrate awareness and understanding of American culture, media, society, history and/or current events, as well as of shared American-Zimbabwean values and interests. Activities should have the potential to reach a significant and diverse audience, engage and sustain that audience over time, and facilitate partnership with U.S.-based groups and organizations. 2. Media Literacy to Combat Disinformation: The program will work to increase public resilience to disinformation and misinformation campaigns. Successful proposals will include ideas to increase public understanding of, and to push back against, disinformation and misinformation activities. Activities and work funded with this award may include (but should not be limited to): &#183; Investigative reporting; &#183; Public debates and moderated discussions; and/or &#183; Digital engagements We encourage new and creative approaches that use digital technology, social media, and other innovative means. Successful proposals will emphasize the ability to deliver clear messages to key audiences: Women, youth, policy makers, opinion leaders and other clearly defined sectors. The PD Section will favorably note proposals that aim to establish partnerships with American universities or colleges to include media literacy or consumption as parts of existing curricula or to otherwise augment relevant discussions at college education level. A program goal should be to encourage fact-checking and responsible media consumption using learned skills or available resources and platforms. 3. Media Sustainability, Innovation and Professionalization: The PD Section will accept proposals from organizations that seek to assist emerging news organizations- online and offline- develop and adopt business plans or strategies and diversify revenue to ensure their survival in challenging economic times. Initiatives should help news outlets harness the power of digital tools as well as community resources to create sustainable media businesses that provide news and information in the public interest. The PD Section will also accept proposals from organizations that seek to support exposure, collaboration among professionals among journalism community in new ways of gathering information, tell stories and engage audiences in the areas of health, human rights, agriculture/ STEM, and Peace and Conflict resolution. Programs should enhance news coverage and enable these organizations to embrace or expand ways of gathering and disseminating information as well as connect more deeply with their audiences. The ultimate goal is to increase the flow of reliable news and information to the Zimbabwean public. Program Goals: The goal of this program is to strengthen ties between the United States and Zimbabwe&#8217;s journalism and media institutions to: 1. Increase public awareness of international best practices in fundamental freedom of speech and a free press. 2. Increase public resilience to disinformation and misinformation campaigns through expanding or increasing outlets for sharing verified information to the public. 3. Develop the institutional networks that result in greater competitiveness and sustainability of independent media outlets through ethical and innovative approaches to generating income and professional partnerships. 4. Support independent news and information media outlets (broadcast, online, and print) that are committed to factual, objective and thorough reporting of identified issues including but not limited to Health, Entrepreneurship, Human Rights and Labor, Peace and Conflict resolution, Green Energy, Cyber Security, and Anticorruption. 5. Support innovative approaches to using technology, including alternative delivery platforms, to more effectively inform Zimbabwean audiences. Key outcomes include, but not limited to, the ability of news outlets to cover or investigate previously challenging assignments, reach more audiences, and journalists are better informed on selected subjects; expand access to local and international sources of information. NOTE: For program proposals that include elements of in-person travel between Zimbabwe and the United States, or other international locations, travel should not be planned until September 2022 at the earliest. All program proposals, including those with exchange components, should include flexibility in planning to adjust given the constantly evolving global and local restrictions related to COVID-19. All program proposals must strengthen ties and build networks between the United States and Zimbabwe and must have a strong, central, American element, or connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s (separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Mission or its American Corners or U.S. government exchange program alumni), and have as a primary goal the promotion of increased understanding of U.S. values, perspectives, and policies and relationship building between Americans and Zimbabweans. Participants and Audiences: Proposals must engage with Zimbabwean media institutions or media workers as well as audiences.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONThe Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Office of Press and Public Diplomacy (NEA/PPD), in cooperation with the Syria Transition Assistance Response Team Public Diplomacy (START PD) office of the U.S. Department of State, is pleased to announce this open competition for organizations and individuals to submit applications to carry out a public diplomacy program to advance U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives for Syria. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) outlines NEA/PPD&#8217;s and START PD funding priorities, strategic and thematic areas of focus, and procedures to submit applications for funding. Please carefully review and follow all instructions below to ensure conformance with the procedures for application. Priority Region: Northeast Syria and projects focused on Syrian populations in Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon; projects for implementation in countries other than Syria are subject to the approval of U.S. diplomatic missions in those countries. Program Objectives: NEA/PPD and START PD invite proposals from eligible not-for-profit organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), and individuals to design and implement public diplomacy programs that support U.S. policy goals and objectives in Syria. See &#8220;Priority Program Areas&#8221; below for descriptions of the types of programmatic activities NEA/PPD and START PD have identified as complementary from a public diplomacy standpoint to the advancement of U.S. policy objectives delineated below. Under Section B. Federal Award Information, the U.S. Congressional legislation that serves as the basis for public diplomacy funding and programming is described. Prospective applicants should review this carefully to ensure their proposal(s) are aligned with the intent of this legislation. U.S. policy goals and objectives&#61607; Expanding Humanitarian Access: Support the removal of barriers to aid delivery to address humanitarian needs across Syria &#61607; Accountability and Justice: Support efforts to hold the Assad regime accountable for its gross violations of human rights and international norms&#61607; Political Process: Laying the foundation for, and generating momentum towards, a political solution to the Syrian crisis consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 2254&#61607; The Enduring Defeat of al-Qa&#8217;ida and ISIS: Preserving the U.S. military presence and partnership with the Syrian Democratic Forces to maintain pressure on ISIS and al-Qa&#8217;ida&#61607; Supporting Ceasefires: Supporting international and/or local agreements to reduce levels of violence NEA/PPD and START PD will prioritize projects that build mutual understanding among affected communities, support moderate voices, and foster a positive sense of identity, cultural pride, and community empowerment in regions or countries where prospective projects may be implemented. Building the capacity of local partners and community organizations is a key tenet of NEA/PPD and START PD funded programs. Hence, international or U.S.-based applicants are expected to partner with local partners in the project&#8217;s country of focus to assist these local partners in building their capacity. Such partnership can take the form of the local organization(s) assisting in beneficiary selection, design and implementation of activities, and evaluation of program impact and effectiveness; potential local partners should be identified in the application.NEA/PPD and START PD require applicants be in good legal standing and have all the necessary approvals with appropriate government authorities in the country where the project will be implemented. Award recipients will be required to maintain such legal standing throughout the lifespan of the award, including for any sub-grant and/or sub-contract made under its auspices. Priority Program Areas (include, but are not limited to):&#8226; Strengthening youth community engagement: Strong civic engagement is an essential ingredient in fostering an engaged citizenry, social cohesion, democratic norms and values, and rendering societies more resistant to pernicious forces. Projects in this category would inspire youth to engage more fully and positively in their home communities, thereby strengthening the social fabric within them. Consistent with public diplomacy initiatives, projects in this category could engage a community or communities in a shared endeavor via sports, the fine or performing arts, etc. &#8226; Peacebuilding and reconciliation: The philosopher Spinoza wrote (1670), &#8220;Peace is not an absence of war, it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.&#8221; Projects in this category would promote peace as a positive virtue as expressed in this statement, thereby increasing prospects for reconciliation amongst groups in conflict, e.g. initiatives related to non-violent conflict mitigation and/or promoting constructive dialog among different communities. &#8226; Education: Despite significant U.S. government and other donors&#8217; investment in this sector, substantial deficits in Syrian children&#8217;s and youth&#8217;s access to education remain. Hence programs should be designed to address some of these deficits and/or offer educational activities not currently available. Just some examples include programs in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM); in-service training for educators to increase their capacity for effective curricular delivery; sports, recreational, and/or extra-curricular program for girls in particular; working with government ministries responsible for education to streamline processes for enrollment of students; or assisting young adult drop-outs with transitioning to employment. &#8226; Strengthening the media sector and/or enhancing journalistic skills to develop the professional capacity of practitioners in this field, thereby enabling them to combat disinformation. &#8226; Promote inclusive economic growth and socio-economic development: According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses (defined as less than 500 employees with an average of 10) account for two-thirds of net new job growth and 44% of U.S. economic activity. Projects in this category would focus on sharing U.S. expertise and practices for starting and/or growing a small business enterprise, with the goal of increasing value for the business owner and the firm&#8217;s employees alike. &#8226; Countering the ideology of Designated Terrorist Organizations (DTO): Many DTOs possess relatively sophisticated communications operations designed to persuade listeners of the DTO&#8217;s worldview and to recruit new members to their ranks. Public diplomacy supported initiatives have adopted a variety of approaches to counter DTO activity in this sphere, such as counter-messaging programs tailored to the local socio-cultural context delivered by messengers with outstanding credibility. Projects in this category would serve to strengthen individual and community resilience to deter DTOs&#8217; propaganda and recruitment efforts whether locally or internationally. ** Note: Applications in the priority area of &#8220;Countering the ideology of DTOs&#8221; will be accepted only for projects slated for implementation within Syria itself. Project proposals for all other &#8216;Priority Program Areas&#8217; will be accepted for all countries and/or regions described in &#8216;Priority Region&#8217; above. </td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

USAID/Egypt is seeking feedback on the notional lines of effort and questions outlined below. USAID/Egypt is NOT planning on providing any funding based on the responses received; USAID/Egypt is simply inviting those involved or interested in this concept to provide information no later than March 9, 2022 (17:00 local Cairo time) to the Contracting Officer, Martin Fischer (mfischer@usaid.gov) and the Contracting Specialists: Nehal Elkhatib (nelkhatib@usaid.gov) and Sandra Boulis (sboulis@usaid.gov). Overall Goals and potential means: The overall goal of the proposed programming would be to protect the unique ecosystem located in the southern Red Sea region (roughly defined as the coastal and littoral areas between Hurghada and Shalateen) through support for conservation initiatives undertaken by public, private, and nonprofit sectors in close coordination with local communities. To this end, USAID/Egypt is considering supporting the development of sustainable, nature-based tourism in this area that links revenues - including community livelihoods - to the conservation of natural resources, including coral reefs, marine life and ecosystems, and other unique attributes. USAID/Egypt is considering the following activities: - Support for an endowment fund to &#8220;crowd in&#8221; investment from other actors - including private companies, international organizations, government authorities, charitable organizations, and others - with an interest in developing tourism infrastructure supportive of conservation and sustainable development of the southern Red Sea region. - Support to national and government authorities on legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks concerning biodiversity and climate change, and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations. - Support for programming which ensures that tourism revenues fairly benefit local communities and that built infrastructure accounts for local needs and priorities as well as environmental considerations. Questions: Promotion of sustainable tourism - What, if any, are current impediments to investment in tourism infrastructure in the south Red Sea region? - What kinds of infrastructure (transport, dining, accommodation) is needed to attract high-value, low-impact tourism to this region? - What role should assurance, standards, and certifications play in the planning, development and management of tourism in this region, both at the firm level and at the destination level? - What additional interventions may be valuable (i.e. upskilling and training, policies and regulations, destination management/marketing) to increase the tourism offer and revenues? Conservation needs - What are the highest priority conservation needs in this area? To what extent are they supported by ongoing initiatives? - How can USAID support conservation in a way that will be sustainable after our investments have been made? - What laws, policies, and regulations are conducive to or support conservation practices in this region? - What enforcement mechanisms are in place to uphold existing regulations? Is there a need for additional support or measures to improve compliance with laws and regulations? Stakeholders - How can local communities lead conservation and/or tourism initiatives? - For would-be investors: what form of investment are you contemplating? What, if any, of the above interventions would facilitate your willingness/ability to invest? - Are there existing mechanisms, such as endowment funds or other types of permanent institutions, dedicated to addressing some or all of these issues? - What existing institutions/champions (public, private, or non-governmental) are important to consult and coordinate with in the potential efforts outlined above? Resources - USAID/Egypt is consulting a range of studies and assessments regarding the relationship between tourism, conservation, and sustainable development in this region, including the following: -Science, Diplomacy, and the Red Sea&#8217;s Unique Coral Reef: It&#8217;s Time for Action - LIFE Red Sea Project - Enhancing Sustainable Tourism in the Southern Red Sea Region Of Egypt - Sustainable Tourism along the Red Sea: Still Possible? - How Eco is Eco-Tourism? A Systematic Assessment of Resorts on the Red Sea, Egypt - Obstacles to Sustainable Tourism Development on the Red Sea Coast What additional resources should we consult?</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

By addressing priorities at the local scale that are relevant across the US, CIVIC is laying the foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research and technology capabilities and civic priorities through joint partnerships involving civic stakeholders and the research community. CIVIC funds projects that pilot state-of-the-art solutions over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities. Building on other stakeholder-engaged research programs such as NSF&#8217;s Smart &amp; Connected Communities program, CIVIC is uniquely designed to enable transition to practice of innovations into communities, as follows: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, asking communities to identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and then to partner with researchers to address those priorities; (2) CIVIC focuses on research-centered solutions that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world outcomes can be evaluatedwithin 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires a coalition of civic partners and stakeholders and a multi-disciplinary set of researchers to co-create and execute pilot projects; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters nationwide &#8220;communities of practice&#8221; around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both the pre-development and piloting stages. For this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates. For purposes of clarity, civic partners and stakeholders may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities. CIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition withtwo tracks centered around the following topic areas: Track A. Living in a changing climate: pre-disaster action around adaptation, resilience, and mitigation; and Track B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services &amp; community needs. In Stage 1,approximately 50 Planning Grant awards will be made &#8211; each with a budget of up to $50,000 for six months to undertake planning and team development activities. These include solidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing a well-developed full proposal for submission to Stage 2. Only awardees of Stage 1 proposals will be eligible to submit for Stage 2. In Stage 2,approximately20 Full Awards will be made. These will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients. For Stage 2, proposals will be considered with budgets up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months. Proposals must describe how the PIs will execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects. Throughout both stages, NSF grantee (NSF award 1931690) MetroLab Network (metrolabnetwork.org, nsfcivicinnovation.org) will foster &#8220;communities of practice&#8221; through in-person and virtual activities, aimed at enhancing the teams&#8217; capacity-building, networking, impact, and ability to create methods and solutions transferable to other communities. The CIVIC research and action competition is jointly supported by NSF&#8217;s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Directorate for Engineering (ENG),Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), and Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). NSF may share proposals submitted in response to this solicitation with other federal agencies interested in funding projects.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Yet Zimbabwe&#8217;s agricultural land, forests, and biodiversity are in steep decline due to climate events, increased poverty, population growth, poor land use planning, and weak governance. The decline in agricultural production, especially in Natural Regions IV and V (where annual rainfall is less than 650 mm[1], with frequent seasonal droughts, erratic rainfall and severe dry spells) has resulted in increased food insecurity, as well as reduced household nutrition and income. Consequently, there is often crop failure and/or livestock losses that necessitate vulnerable households seeking alternative income sources to procure food and purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, calves, and fertilizers for the next farming season. Of the nearly 6,000 species of indigenous plants found in the country, some 900 of them have traditional use as food, cosmetics or medicine within these two Natural Regions and are supplementary sources of income for 60 - 70 percent of rural households who live there[2]. With the growing awareness of the nutritional and health benefits that NTFPs offer, there has been an increased demand to commercialize. For example, baobab fruit has been granted a novel foods clearance by the EU and can be exported from Zimbabwe. There are also several companies in Zimbabwe and in the region that buy and process NTFPs and are ready to offer markets to rural producers[3]. Return on investment (mainly labor for collection and processing) is much higher than from any of the major cash crops. For example, in Mutoko and Mudzi districts, it is USD 62.80 for Mobola seed and USD 14.08 for Sour Plum compared to USD 1.68 for groundnuts, which is the major cash earner in the two districts. Therefore, the Activity will seek ways to sustainably commercialize non-timber forest products in order to increase alternative income sources, improve natural resource management practices that will promote biodiversity, and reduce human-wildlife conflict. Target districts will be those districts where the NTFPs of most commercial value are of harvestable commercial quantities. The specific Activity objectives are: &#9679; Increased production and supply of non-timber forest products to meet domestic and international market demands; &#9679; Increased investments by local, regional and international marketers in the communities and on infrastructure that will ensure supply of quality products that meet international standards; and &#9679; Improved natural resource management and sustainable forest management practices that promote biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict. The illustrative activity interventions to be implemented include: &#9679; Capacity building of communities on good non-timber forest products production practices that will ensure increased production of quality products that meet international standards; &#9679; Introduction and promotion of low-cost technologies that improve efficiency, reduce production costs and improve quality of products; &#9679; Introduction of certification procedures that increase the value and acceptability of the products in local and international markets; &#9679; Build capacity on good governance models for community groups to improve business accountability; &#9679; Build capacity of communities on improved natural resources management practices that promotes biodiversity and reduces human wildlife conflicts; &#9679; Increase community groups&#8217; capacity to anticipate and respond to potential shocks and stresses; &#9679; Support communities to identify and address potential or existing conflicts; and Promote consumption of diverse and nutrient dense diets for children and adults</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Modification Comments:</td><td>Attaching supporting documents</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

Four Institutes will take place over the course of five weeks in summer 2023 and one Institute will take place in winter 2024. See details in NOFO section A.4. Program Administration. The SUSIs for Global Student Leaders provide multinational groups of undergraduate students with a deeper understanding of U.S. society, culture, and institutions. Each of the five Institutes focuses on a theme or topics in U.S. studies and will be five weeks in duration, including an approximately four-week academic residency at a U.S. academic institution and an approximately one-week integrated educational study tour. The academic residency should take place on a U.S. university or college campus and should include academic coursework as well as weekly community service activities, weekly leadership and skills development sessions, and opportunities for interaction with speakers from diverse backgrounds and interaction with American peers. The study tour should take participants to another region of the United States and complement the academic residency. The program should include opportunities for continued follow-on engagement once participants return home.

Applications to identify biomarkers or biomarker signatures that predict or monitor a therapeutic response across several related pain conditions should feature Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI)-led teams that represent each of the related pain conditions and associated clinical networks. The MPI-led teams are expected to decide upon a single set of measures or biomarker modalities (i.e., combination of omics, QST, actigraphy, EEG, digital measures, etc.) as components of the biosignature for all pain conditions represented in the application. Applications should feature centralized resource groups that will coordinate clinical trials and standardize all sample or data collection methods, technology development, statistical analysis and algorithm development across the pain conditions under investigation. Applications seeking to develop biomarkers or biomarker signatures that will be used to predict and/or monitor a therapeutic response for a single pain condition must also feature MPI-led teams that represent the cross functional expertise necessary for biomarker and/or signature development, along with the same types of centralized resource groups that coordinate clinical trials and standardize sample or data collection methods, technology development and statistical analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

For selected projects, the NPS makes financial assistance awards to the lead agency, which will be responsible for ensuring that allocated funds are used for the purposes of and in a manner consistent with this program, including any funds awarded to eligible sub-applicants. &#160;As the primary grantee for any sub-awarded grants, the lead agency is&#160;responsible for overseeing the day-to-day implementation of the grant and the supported activities to assure the project&#8217;s compliance with the LWCF Act and Manual, other applicable Federal requirements, and that performance goals are being achieved. &#160;The NPS cannot make grants to entities other than the state lead agency; applications submitted to this funding opportunity announcement by an entity other than the state lead agency will be automatically eliminated.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>Agency Code:</td><td>DOI-NPS</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'>Agency Name:</td><td>Department of the Interior<br>National Park Service</td></tr><tr><td>Posted Date:</td><td>Feb 09, 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Close Date:</td><td>Mar 18, 2022 Applicants are responsible for their proposals being submitted to the National Park Service.

Applications sent by facsimile, email, or mail delivery will not be accepted. Applications submitted to Grants.gov after the deadline will not be accepted.&#160; The receipt date and time stamp given by Grants.gov will establish whether the application met the deadline.&#160; An applicant&apos;s failure to meet an eligibility criterion by the time of the application deadline may result in the application being excluded from consideration during this cycle.&#160; This includes but is not limited to late and incomplete application packages. You are encouraged to submit the application well before the deadline and not wait until the last minute. &#160;The uploading and transfer process can take a while, especially when Grants.gov is getting heavy use. In addition, after the application is submitted it gets validated before it is forwarded to the NPS. &#160;Normally this happens within a few minutes to a couple of hours, but it can take Grants.gov up to a day or two to validate or reject an application.&#160; You can monitor your application&#8217;s status by email.&#160; You will receive four (4) emails from Grants.gov in the submittal process:&#160; the first confirms successful receipt and contains a Grants.gov tracking number; the second confirms that the application has been validated; the third confirms the application was &#8220;received&#8221; by the agency, and the fourth assigns an NPS tracking number. &#160;If you do not get the first email, you should assume the application did not successfully submit to Grants.gov.&#160; If you do not receive all four emails, you should assume the application was not actually forwarded to NPS, notwithstanding the email about receipt, in which case you should let your NPS program officer know.&#160; Sometimes there are glitches that prevent actual transmission, for example, applications that exceed 25mg in size do not get forwarded to the DOI system.&#160; Most problems occur at the validation step so you should always check the second email; if there was a problem it should be described in this email. &#160;Technical difficulties with application submittal should be directed to the Grants.gov help desk.

Land acquisition and development grants may be in support of a wide range of outdoor recreation uses, such as community parks, playgrounds, picnic areas, campgrounds, trails, swimming pools, and sports fields; as well as for certain indoor infrastructure that supports these activities such as restrooms. Outdoor recreation areas and facilities must be publicly owned as well as open to the general public and not limited to special groups.The process for applying for a grant begins at the State or Territory level; entities interested in applying for an LWCF grant must contact their State&#8217;s lead agency to find out details about the availability of funds, timing of grant process, State program priorities, funding criteria, etc. A list of agency contacts can be found at: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/contact-list.htm. The lead agency is responsible for soliciting project proposals from other State agencies, local units of government, and Indian Tribes and conducting competitions to identify the projects that can best advance the goals or meet the needs identified in the State&#8217;s SCORP. The top ranked projects, within the funds available, are nominated to the NPS for consideration and final decision, as well as the actual award of a grant.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>

To be processed in this funding cycle, complete applications must be submitted by Friday, March 18, 11:59 PM ET.&#160; Applications must be submitted electronically through Grants.gov. Applications sent by facsimile, email, or mail delivery will not be accepted. Applications submitted to Grants.gov after the deadline will not be accepted.&#160; The receipt date and time stamp given by Grants.gov will establish whether the application met the deadline.&#160; An applicant&apos;s failure to meet an eligibility criterion by the time of the application deadline may result in the application being excluded from consideration during this cycle.&#160; This includes but is not limited to late and incomplete application packages. You are encouraged to submit the application well before the deadline and not wait until the last minute. &#160;The uploading and transfer process can take a while, especially when Grants.gov is getting heavy use. In addition, after the application is submitted it gets validated before it is forwarded to the NPS. &#160;Normally this happens within a few minutes to a couple of hours, but it can take Grants.gov up to a day or two to validate or reject an application.&#160; You can monitor your application&#8217;s status by email.&#160; You will receive four (4) emails from Grants.gov in the submittal process:&#160; the first confirms successful receipt and contains a Grants.gov tracking number; the second confirms that the application has been validated; the third confirms the application was &#8220;received&#8221; by the agency, and the fourth assigns an NPS tracking number. &#160;If you do not get the first email, you should assume the application did not successfully submit to Grants.gov.&#160; If you do not receive all four emails, you should assume the application was not actually forwarded to NPS, notwithstanding the email about receipt, in which case you should let your NPS program officer know.&#160; Sometimes there are glitches that prevent actual transmission, for example, applications that exceed 25mg in size do not get forwarded to the DOI system.&#160; Most problems occur at the validation step so you should always check the second email; if there was a problem it should be described in this email. &#160;Technical difficulties with application submittal should be directed to the Grants.gov help desk.

Each fiscal year Congress allocates money from the LWCF for this program, which is in turn allocated to the States based on a legislative formula. To be eligible to submit applications for funding, States must have a current Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan, or SCORP, in place that assesses demand and need for outdoor recreation resources and sets priorities for the use of LWCF funds. LWCF grants are available to the States to comply with this legislative requirement. The NPS must review and approve each State&#8217;s SCORP.

Eligibility Requirements Applicants for the Resident Instruction Grants for Institutions of Higher Education in Insular Areas (RIIA) and Agriculture and Food Sciences Facilities and Equipment (AGFEI) programs must meet all the requirements discussed in this RFA. Failure to meet the eligibility criteria by the application deadline may result in exclusion from consideration or, preclude NIFA from making an award. For those new to Federal financial assistance, NIFA&#8217;s Grants Overview provides highly recommended information about grants and other resources to help understand the Federal awards process. 1. Individual Institutions. For the purposes of the RIIA program, an eligible institution is an institution of higher education, as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1995 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)); is located at an Insular Area; and has a demonstrable capacity to carry out teaching and extension programs in the food and agricultural sciences. All public or non-profit 2-year and 4-year accredited institutions of higher education that offer certificate/degree programs in the food and agricultural sciences are eligible. For the purposes of the AGFEI program, only individual land-grant colleges and universities, and other institutions that have secured land-grant status through Federal legislation, and which are located at Insular Areas are eligible for awards under this RFA as individual applicants. The eight Insular Areas are: a. American Samoa, b. the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, c. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, d. the Federated States of Micronesia, e. Guam, f. the Republic of the Marshall Islands, g. the Republic of Palau, and h. the United States Virgin Islands 2. Branch Institutions of a Territory University System. For the purposes of the RIIA and AGFEI programs, the individual branches of a territory university system that are separately accredited as degree-granting institutions are treated as separate, individual institutions eligible to apply for and receive awards, provided they otherwise satisfy the definition of &#8220;eligible institution&#8221; as specified above. 3. Independent Branch Campuses. Independent branch campuses of individual institutions may apply for and receive grant awards under this program, provided that they otherwise satisfy the definition of &#8220;eligible institution&#8221; as specified above. 4. Certification of Eligibility. At the time of application, each primary applicant will be required to demonstrate or certify that it is an eligible institution as defined by this RFA. A non-Land Grant institution must submit a letter signed by the institution&#8217;s Authorized Representative (AR) certifying that it meets the requirements of an &#8220;eligible institution&#8221; as defined above. The AR must also certify the institution, or parent institution in the case of an independent branch campus. a. Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate. b. Is legally authorized by the Territory in which it is located to provide a program of education beyond secondary education. c. Provides an educational program for which the institution awards a bachelor&#8217;s degree or provides not less than a 2-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward such 13 a degree. d. Is a public or other nonprofit institution; and is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association, or if not so accredited, is an institution that has been granted pre-accreditation status by such an agency or association that has been recognized by the Secretary for the granting of pre- accreditation status, and the Secretary has determined that there is satisfactory assurance that the institution will meet the accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a reasonable time.

DRL&#8217;s goal is to increase youth mobilization to foster inclusion and participation in policy development and decision making at all levels of government. The bureau seeks proposals that empower youth to become agents of positive change within their own communities and strengthen young people&#8217;s knowledge of basic principles of leadership, transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and civic participation, enabling them to engage more fully with their local governments and communities. The program objectives are: 1) youth and youth-led organizations have increased leadership skills and strengthened networks to engage more meaningfully in decision-making processes and implementation of policies that impact youth and their communities; and 2) youth and youth-led organizations are empowered to advance and protect fundamental freedoms, acting as catalysts to increase awareness of governance issues among young people and other community members.</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr></table></TD></TR></TABLE> ]]>
